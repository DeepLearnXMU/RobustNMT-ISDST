They know, one of the great wrath when traveling and one of the joy in the ethnographic forschung is to live together with the people who can still remember the old times, who still feel their past in the wind, they touch on the rain glätted stones, they taste in the bitter blättern of the plant.
Simply das know that jaguar-shamanen still jenseits der milchstraße travel or the meaning of the myths of the eldest der inuit are still voller meaning, or that in Himalaya the Buddhists still den atem des dharma verfolgen, means that the central revelation of anthropology ins memory to call, that is the thought that the world, in which we live, does not exist in an absolute mind, but only as a model of reality, as a follicle of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation that our ahnen, wenngleich successfully, before many generations chose.
And of course we share all the diesel adaptation needs.
We will all be born, we will bring children to the world.
We are going through the initiations rituals.
We must confront ourselves with the irresistible separation through the tod and therefore it should not surprise us that we all sing, dance and and produce art.
But interesting is the unique tonfall of the lies, the rhythm of the dances in every culture.
It does not matter whether it is about the penan in the forests of Borneo handelt, or the voodoo-acolythen in Haiti, or the rusger in the kaisut-wast of Nordkenia, the curanderos in the other, or a karawanserei in the middle of the Sahara. this is random the college, with whom I am before a month in the desert travel bin. or even a yak-hirte in the hängen des qomolangma, everest, the gottmutter of the world.
All these men teach us that there are other possibilities of existence, other ways of thinking, other ways of orientation on the ground.
And that’s an imagination that, when you think about it, you can only fulfill with hope.
Together, the countless cultures of the world form a netz out of spiritual and cultural life, that the herd is surrounded and for the well-being of the herd is as important as the biological life network, that man knows as a biosphere.
The ethnosphere can be defined as the whole sum of all thoughts and dreams, myths of ideas, inspirations and intuitions, which have been constructed by the human imagination since the beginning of the awareness.
The ethnosphere is the great fortune of mankind.
She is the symbol of all of what we are and what we are as erstaunlich wissbegierige species capable of being.
And just as the biosphere was strongly absorbed, this happened with the ethnosphere — only with even greater speed.
No biologist would, for example, wagen to behave that 50 percent or more of all species are extinct before them, because it is simply not true. and yet, this — the apocalyptic scenario on the field of biological diversity — corresponds hardly to those, which is known as the optimistic scenario on the field of cultural diversity.
And the crucial indicator for this is the austerben of the speech.
When each of them was born in this room, 6,000 words were spoken on the land.
Now a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a series of grammatical rules.
A speech is the expression of the human spirit.
It is a means with which the soul of a particular culture finds access to the material world.
Every speech is like an altbestehender wald des geistes, a wende point, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of these 6,000 speech will be today, while we sit here in Monterey, exactly the half is no longer in the ears of kindern geflüstert.
They will be kleinkindern no longer taught. that is, if nothing will be done, they are actually already all.
What could be lonely, as if we were silently overwhelmed, being one of the last deines of the people who speak your word, not having the possibility to disclose the wisdom of the predecessors, or the hope of children to expect?
And yet widerfährt this terrible fate actually someone somewhere on the earth, about all two weeks, because all two weeks, a elderly man dies and takes the last silves of an old speech with himself ins grab.
And I know that some of them say: &quot; is it not better so? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we all were just one language to speak? &quot; and I say: &quot; well, let this language be yoruba.
Let her be kogi sein. &quot;
And then they would suddenly realize what it would be if they could not speak their own speech.
That’s why I want to take them today somehow on a journey through the ethnosphere, a short journey through the ethnosphere, to try to make them understand what is actually lost.
Now there are some among us, which somewhat forget that I, if I know the various possibilities of the seins, &quot; really different possibilities of the seins me.
Take them to the example of this kind of barasana in the northwest of the amazon, the people of the anakonda, believing that they mythologically den milchfluss vom osten her im bauch von heiligen schlangen heraufkamen.
There is a people who is not cognitive between the color blue and green distinguished, since the heavenszelt is equal to the wald, to the people who depend on.
They have a strange speech and a heirat rule that is called linguistic exogamy: one must marry someone who speaks another language.
All this is worn in the mythological past. the strange in this great house, in which, due to the mischehen, six or seven words are spoken, is, however, that one never hears anyone who learns one language.
They just listen and then begin to speak.
Or, one of the faszinierendst tribes, with which I’ve ever gelebt, the waorani im nordosten of Ecuador, a surprising people, which was first contacted in the year 1958 in peace.
In 1957, five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake.
They warfen glänzende photos of themselves out of the air herab, what we would assess as a friendly gesture, and they disappointed that these men out of the regenwald had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
They hoben these photographs from the waldboden on, attempted behind the face or the figure to see, found nothing and concluded that these visiting cards of the devils were and killed the five missionaries with them speer.
But the waorans kill not only außenstehende with their speer.
They cross each other.
54% of the deaths are caused by throughbohrungen.
We verfolgten the geneology eight generations back and found two cases of a natural todes and when we humans with a pressure something out of it, we gave it to the fact that one of the people became so alt that er because of his alters died and we killed him yet with them speer.
But at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the waldes, which was astonishing.
Their pigs were able to den urine of a thirteen from 40 steps away smell and bestimmen, to which tierart this belonged.
In the early 80iger jahren I got a really amazing task, when my professor in Harvard fragte, whether I would be interested in going to Haiti and the secret societies to infiltrate, which the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes were and the gift, which was used to make zombies, secure.
To give this sensation a mind, I had, of course, something about this remarkable glauben des waterun know and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic.
Imenteil, it is a complex metaphysical worldview.
It is interesting.
If I would ask them what they would say, if I asked them what they would say, if I asked them what they would say?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism or whatever.
A continent will always be exhausted, because the vermutung was that it is in black-Africa no religious believers give. of course there was one and voodoo is simply the overbleibsel of this very deep religious thought, which during the tragic diaspora of the slavery time herüberkamen.
But was voodoo so interesting power, is this living relationship between the living and the toten.
The living ones are the ghosts.
The ghosts can be replicated to the rhythm of the tances, to the soul of the living temporarily to permeate, so that the acolyth for a short glowing moment becomes to God.
Deshab says the voodooists like, &quot; their white goes into the church and speaks about God.
We dance in the temple and become to god. &quot;
And because you are obsessed, you will be ingested by the spirit of them. how can you be damaged?
They see these astonishing demonstrations: voodoo-acolythen in a trance state, the glühende kohle without burning anfassend, a astonishing veranschaulichung of the ability of the spirits of the body to influence so that this is outstanding when it is in a state of the extreme erregung is placed.
Now, of all the men I have met, were the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern Colombia, the most exceptional.
Following the ancient tyrannical civilization, which populated the Caribbean Customs of Colombia, and in the wake of the eruption, this people moved back into an isolated volcanic massive, which rises over the Caribbean Customs.
In a blutbeflecked continent, these men were the only ones who were not erected by the Spanish.
up to the present tag, they are governed by a ritual priesthood. the formation to the priesthood is however very extraordinary.
The young acolythen will be separated from their families in the alter of three and four jahren and in a schattenhaften world of the finsternis, in steinhütten am fuße der gletscher for 18 jahre abschotted. two times of each nine jahren, deliberately chosen, about the nine months of pregnancy, which they spend in the shell of their bodily mother, they will spend nun metamorphorisch in the shell of the great mother.
And throughout this time, they will be culturally introduced into the values of their society. values that maintain the behavior that their prayers and only their prayers, the cosmic — or we could say the ecological — maintain the balance.
At the end of this amazing initiation they will be one tag suddenly out-of-the-counter and for the first time in their lives, in the alter of 18 years, they will see a sonnenaufgang. and in this crystal clear moment of the awareness of the first light, when the sun begins to shine on the hangs of the amazingly beautiful landscape, suddenly all that they have learned in the abstract pracht will be confirmed. and the priest tritt back and says, &quot; see you? it is really, as I have told you.
It’s so wonderful. you must protect it. &quot;
They call themselves the older brothers and say that we, who are the younger brothers, are responsible for the destruction of the world.
Now this ebene of intuition becomes very important.
Whenever we think of an inbound and landscape, we argue either rousseau and the old geruch of the noble wild hereaf, which in its simplification is a racist thought or, on the other hand, thoreau and say, these people are more connected to nature than we.
Also, ingeborene are neither sentimental, nor are they weakened by the nostalgia.
It remains not a lot of place for it in the malariaverseuchten sümpfen of asmat or the cold winden of Tibet, but they have yet, through time and ritual, a mysterious nimbus of the erde geformt, which is not based on the idea, they are consciously naked, but on a much more subtle intuition, the idea that the erde in itself can only exist, because it is in the human consciousness hineingeatmet.
So, what does that mean?
It means that a small kind from the other, that in them glauben rises, that the mountain is an apu-geist, that his or her fate bestimmen, will become a whole other man, and a different relationship with this resource or this place have, as a small kind from montana, that in them glauben rises, that a mountain is a haufen stone, which can be taken away.
whether it is a residence of a geist or a haufen erz is, it is irrelevant.
The interesting is the metaphor, which defines the relationship between the individual and the nature.
I wuchs in the forests of British Columbia up and believe that these forests are there to be gerodet.
That made me to another man as my friends among the kwakiutl, who believe that these forests are the residence of the law and the gebogenen heavenly snables and the cannibalistic spirits, who live in the north of the world, the spirits, which they would be involved in their hamatsa initiation.
Now, when one begins to consider the idea that these cultures can create different realities, one can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries.
It’s a photo that I’ve taken up until last April in the northwest of the Amazon.
This is ayahuasca, from which many of them have heard, the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire des schamanen.
was ayahuasca so faszinierend power, is not only the pharmacological potential of this preparation, but its processing. it is actually produced from two different sources. on one seat, there is this wood liane, which is a variety of betakarboline, harmin, harmolin, slightly hallucinogenic, birgt. this cletterplantage alone is enzyme is approximately so as if a blue-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber-tuber.
This plant contains some very strong tryptamine that are very similar to serotonin, dimethyltryptamine-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine.
If you’ve ever seen the yanomami, how you see this zeug, this substance that you produce from different species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
This powder to snupfen is approximately as from a wreath to be shattered, gesäumt von barocken gemälden and der landing on a lake of electricity.
It is not the disturbance of reality that will arise, but the dissolution of reality.
I have even discussed this with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man, who has the psychedelic area with the discovery of the magical pills in Mexico in the 30iger jahren introduced, I behave that this tryptamine cannot be arranged as a hallucinogen, since in that moment in them man feels the effects, man is no longer there to experience a hallucination.
But the thing with tryptamine is that they cannot be taken orally, as they are denaturated by an in human intestine naturally occurring enzyme called monoamin-oxidase.
They can only be taken orally in connection with some other chemicals that denaturate the mao.
Now the fascinating thing is that the beta-carboline, which is contained in the liane, are the mao-inhibitors of precisely the art, which is necessary to enhance the tryptamine.
How can these men from a flora of 80,000 species of adstringierender pflanzen find these two morphologically unrelated pflanzen that, when combined to this way, create an art of biochemical version, so that the whole is greater than the sum of it is to you?
We use this great euphemism, attempt and errors, which appears to be meaningless.
But ask man the Indian says she : &quot; the pflanze speaks to us . &quot;
So, what does that mean?
This stamm, the cofan, has 17 variants of an ayahuasca, which they all recognize at the great distance of im wald, which appear to our eyes as an art.
And then you ask them how they justify their taxonomy and they say: &quot; I thought you understand something of pflanzen.
I mean, do you know nothing at all? &quot; and I said: &quot; no. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Also, it turns out that you each of the 17 variants at fullmond mitnimmt and they sing to one in a different tone.
Nun, das brings them no doctorate in Harvard, but it is much more interesting than stamina to count.
Now, the problem- the problem is that even those among us, who have the sympathy for the difficult low of the inborn, see them as original and colorful, but they somehow limit to the past, while the real world, i.e. our world, progresses.
Thus, it is that in the 20th century, in 300 years, you will not be remembered for your Russian or technical innovations, but rather as a glory in which we were attached and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the ground either actively supported or passively accepted.
All cultures have repeatedly engaged in the dance with new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology itself.
The sioux-indians heard not less of being on sioux as they gave up the bogen and pfeil, as the Americans gave up being the Americans, as they gave up the horse and horse cars.
No change and technology undermine the integrity of the ethnosphere. it is power. the wicked face of the rule.
And wherever you see yourself in the world, you will discover that these cultures are not dedicated to the fall. these are dynamically living peoples, whose existence will be distorted by recognizable forces that will go beyond their capacity of adaptation. if it is about the incredible abholzation in the homeland of the penan, a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak, a people who lived before a generation free in the valley, and now to slavery and prostitution am flussufer has been humiliated, from where they can see that even the flow with them will be contaminated, the fast half borneo in the southern China will be contaminated, the fast half borneo in the southern China will be contaminated, the fast half borneo in the southern China will be contaminated, the fast half borneo in the southern China will be
Or if we go in the mountains of Tibet, where I neuerlich much forsche, you will see the wicked face of political dominance.
They know that the genocide, the physical extinction of men, is generally condemned, but the ethnozid, the destruction of the way of life of men, is not only not condemned, but generally and generally, as part of a developmental strategy, celebrated.
And they can’t understand the suffering Tibets if they have not experienced it on the understars.
I travel once with a young colleague 6000 miles from chengdu in westchina overland through south-east-tibet to lhasa and only when I went to lhasa kam saw I das face behind the statistics of which man hears . 6000 holy monuments , which were transformed in schutt and asche . 1,2 million people , who were killed during the cultural revolution of the kadern .
The vater of this young man was identified as the follower of the panchen lama.
That means that he was immediately killed during the Chinese invasion.
His uncle floh with her holiness in the diaspora, the people to Nepal brachte.
His mother was imprisoned, as a punishment for — for the crime to be prosperous.
He was smuggled in the alter of two jahren in the prison, to hide himself under her rockzipfel, because she could not live without him.
The sister, who this tapfere tat beging, was brought into a erziehungslager.
One tag pulled her out on an armband of maos and for this overtake she had to spend seven years in a heavy labor camp.
The leiden Tibets can be unerträglich, but the erlösende spirit of man is something unforgettable.
Do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity?
Margaret mead, the great anthropologist said before she died, that it is her greatest fear, that while we uns in the direction of a faden, gestaltless, generic worldview moving, we would not only see the entire bandwidth of the human imagination reduced to an engaged thought, but that we a tag from a trauma awake, and have forgotten that there was ever other possibilities.
And it is demütigend to think that our gattung may have existed since 600,000 jahren.
The neolithic revolution, which brought us the agriculture, and us at this moment the cult of the saatkorns underwarf, the poetry of the shamanen replaced by the prose of the priesthood, and the hierarchy, specialization and surplus created - fand vor merely 10,000 jahren took place.
The modern industrial world as we know it is just 300 years old.
Now, this superficial history doesn’t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we’re facing in the coming millennia.
If we ask these countless world cultures after the meaning of the menschseins, they answer with 10,000 different voices.
And in this song we will rediscover the possibility of being what we are: people with full consciousness, who are aware of the importance that all men and men have a space to be able to prosper, and there are great moments of optimism.
Here is a photo, which I am nördlichen ende der baffin-inseln aufnahm, when I met inuits on the narwhal-jagd went. and this man, olaya, told me a wonderful story of seines großvaters.
The Canadian government is not always very good with the inuit engaged and during the 50iger jahre in the zuge of the establishment of our sovereignty, they were forced, in seedlungen zu ziehen.
The greatder dervater of these old men refused.
The family, the angst of his life had, nahm him all the waves and all the tools ab.
Now they have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold; they have used them for their benefit.
The gleitschienen of their schlitten were originally from fish, which in near-haut eingewickelt was, manufactured.
Dervater des Mannes is not afraid of the Arctic Night or of the Wehenden Storm.
er schlüpfte to the outside, laß his hosen out of seehundsfell herunter and defecated in his hand. and when the facalies to freeren began, it formed it in the form of a messer.
er sprühte speichel on the seiten des fäkalien-messers and if it is completely gefroren war, erstach er a dog with it.
er enthäutete the dog and improvisated a shirt, nahm the skeleton of the dogs and improvisated a shirt, spanned another dog an and entschwand over the eisschollen with them fäkalien-messer am gürtel.
So you can do nothing out of it.
And this is on many signs a symbol for the resistance of the Inuit and all the inherited in the world.
The Canadian government gave the inuit in April 1999 the full control over a region back, which is greater than California and Texas together.
It is our new homeland and is called nunavut.
It is an independent region. it controls all minerals.
A surprising example, like a nation, a state, which is able to seek and<unk> re-gutmachung with its inhabitants.
And letztendlich, I believe, it is quite obvious, at least for those of us who are to these remote zielen der erde gereist, to realize that they are not at all away.
They are someone’s homeland.
They represent you the human imagination, which returns in past times, and for all of us, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of our own children, will be part of the geography of hope.
Was we at national geographic letztendlich try, is that we believe that the politician never achieves anything.
We believe that polemic -- we believe that polemic is not convincing, but we believe that stories can change the world and thus we are probably the best institution for stories in the world.
156 nations send our fernseh channel.
Our newspapers are read by millions.
And we undertake a series of trips into the ethnosphere, on which we bring our audience to the orten of solch cultural wonder that they will be blended by their sighted. and hopefully, they will one after the other accept the central revelation of anthropology: that this world is deserved to exist on various sights, that we can find a possibility of life in a truly multicultural pluralist world, in which the wisdom of all men can contribute to our common well-being.
A lot of thanks.
What I give them first, as soon as possible, will show, is the basic work, a new technology that we have given to Microsoft as part of a takeover before exactly a jahr. that is seadragon. and it is an environment in which they can either locally or remotely deal with enormous mixture of visual data.
We see many, many gigabytes an digital photos here, that man nahtlos and fortwährend heranholen, schwenken, on any way neu can arrange.
And it doesn’t matter how many informationen we look at, how big these sammlungen are or how big the pictures are.
Most of them are digital photos of a camera, but this here is for example a scan of the congress library and it is in a range of 300 megapixels.
It makes no difference, because the only thing that the power of a system like this can limit is the number of pixels on their screen at any time. it also has a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book, an example of non-image-data.
Every split is a chapter, every split is a chapter, every split is a chapter.
In order to prove that it is really about a text and not a picture, we can do something like the tun to really show that this is a real representation of the texts and not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial art, an e-book to read.
I<unk>’t recommend it.
This is a more realistic fall. this is an output of the guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of an abschnitts.
And that really gives them the pleasure and the good experience of a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper to read, which in itself is an art medium with multiple sizes.
We have also done something an der ecke of this special exhibition des the guardian .
We have a false ad with a very high resolution that is much higher than with a normal ad and we have added additional content.
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see them here.
or other models, or even technical specifications.
And this really affects this idea to eliminate these restrictions for the available space on the screen.
We hope that there are no pop-ups and other unsinn means more - that should not be necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this.
And I really don’t want to spend a lot of time here, except to say that we’ll be contributing to this area as well.
But these are all the streets in the U.S.A.
It is located above the erdräumal image of the NASA.
Let us find something else now.
That’s now even live in the internet. you can check it out.
This is a project with the name photosynth, which really connects two different technologies to each other.
The one is seadragon and the other is a very good research on computervision, which is by noah snavely, a university student of the university of Washington, under the advice of Steve Seitz an der uw.
and rick szeliski von microsoft forschung was carried out . a very good collaboration .
This is also live in the internet. it is by seadragon angetrieben.
They can see that when we create this art of anxieties, in which we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiple resolution.
But the spatial arrangement of the images is here in the tate of meaning.
The computervision algorithms have fixed these images together so that they correspond to the real space, in which these images, which all in the sight of the grassi lakes in the Canadian rockies were made, they see here elements of stabilized dias or panoramic image processing and these things were all spatially in relation to each other.
I don’t know exactly if I still have time to show them other environments.
There are some that are much more spatial.
I would just like to show one of the original datasets of noah and that is from a early prototype of photosynth an dem we first in summer have worked to show them that, what I believe, that it is really the point behind this technology, the photosynth-technology is. and this is not necessarily so obvious if you consider the environments that we have on the website.
We have to be sad because of the lawyers and so on.
This is a reconstruction of the cathedral of our lady, which exclusively im computer with imagesn of flickr succeeded. give them simply our lady in flickr a and they will receive images of men in t-shirts and on them university landscapes, etc. each of these orange-colored kegel represents a picture that was discovered as to this model.
Thus these are all flickr-images, and they all stand spatially on this weise in relation to each other.
And we can navigate in this very simple way.
I don’t think I’m going to work at Microsoft.
I am very grateful for the reception here.
I vermute, you can see that these are many different types of cameras: everything is there, from the handy camera to the professional slrs, a fairly large number of them, which all have been gathered together in this environment.
And if possible, I will find some of the seltsamen.
Many of them are from gesichtern verdeckt etc.
Somewhere here is a series of photographs - here are you.
This is actually a poster of our lady, which was properly recorded.
We can switch from them poster to a physical view of this environment.
The point is here that we can settle things with the social environment. it is now daten by all gathered — by them the entire collective memory of it, how, visually the herd looks — and everything is connected with each other.
All these photos are connected to each other and there is something that is greater than the sum of you.
They get a model that arises from the whole land.
See this as the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawlers on a virtual earth.
And that is something that, through the complexity with which the people use it, grows and its use for the user with the application becomes increasingly bigger.
Their own photos are beschildert with metadata that another person has entered.
If someone who has made the effort and all these sacred descriptions has and does not know who they are all, then my photo from our lady-cathedral will suddenly be enriched with all these data and I can use it as a starting point to tune in this room, in this metaverse, the photos of other people use and thus make an art of overgreifender modaler social experience with the use of other anbieterns.
And of course, the side product of all of it are the immensely rich virtual models of any interesting part of the land, which have not only been obtained by overflows or satellite images and so on, but by collective storage.
A lot of thanks.
Does their software allow that at a certain time, within the next years, all the images that are shared by someone in the world will be linked to each other?
She does nothing but discovering.
If they want to create they hyperlinks between the imagesn.
And they do this because of the contents in the images.
And that’s really exciting when you think of the full of semantic information that many of these images possess.
As if you do a web search for images, where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about which image that is.
But what would it be if the picture connects her with all her pictures?
Then the scope of the semantic querverbinding and the foul that arises from it is really enormous. it is a classic network effect.
blaise, das is really incredible. herzlichen glückwunsch.
You have a lot of thanks.
I’ll tell you some things from my book that, as I hope, are in conjunction with other things that you’ve already heard, and I’ll try myself to create a few links, if you don’t notice them.
I want to start with them, was I &quot; official dogma &quot; nenne.
The official dogma of was?
The official glaubensatz of all Western industrialized societies.
The official dogma works so: if our soul is to maximize the common welfare of our citizens, this goes above all through the maximization of the freedom of the individual.
The reason for this is that freedom in itself is good, valuable, meaningful, an indispensable prerequisite for the human.
If humans have freedom, then each of us acts for himself to do the things that maximize our good and no one has to decide for us.
The way to maximize freedom is wahl to maximize.
The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more common good they have.
This is, I think, so deep in our wasserversorgung verankert that there is no one in the mind would come to question it.
It is also deeply rooted in our lives.
I will give you a few reports of what uns modernen progress permits.
This is my supermarket, not big.
I just want to say a little bit about saladdressing.
There are 175 dressings in my supermarket, if you are the 10 different extra olive oils don't count and 12 balsamico-essig that you can buy about a large number of your own salad dessings herzustellen, in them unlikely fall that no one of the 175 in them laden for you is right.
This is the way the supermarket is.
And then they go to the consumer-electronic business about a stereo-installation to gather together -- a speaker, a cd-player, a cassette-player, a radio, an amplifier. and in this one electronic business there are so many stereo-installations.
We can compile 6.5 million different stereo installations from the component that is offered in this one business.
You have to admit that this is a big choice.
In other areas - the world of communication .
It was a time, when I was a junge war, that could man one phone provider have the man wanted, solange er von ma bell kam.
They have their phone gemietet . they have it not bought . TM
A fool of it was that the phone was never cutted.
These take are over.
We now have almost an infinite selection of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is der in der nicht -- mp3-player- , nasen-haar-trimmer und crème brûlée fackel .
And if you haven’t seen it until now in your business, you can be sure that you’ll be it soon.
And what it does is that it brings people to run into the business and ask this question.
Do you know what the answer to this question is?
The answer is &quot; no. &quot;
It’s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn’t do too much.
In other aspects of the life, which are much more significant than the purchase of the present, the same explosion of the possibilities of choice comes to pass.
health - it is no longer the fall in the United States that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them what to tun is.
Instead they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them: we could do a or we could do b.
A has these advantages and risks.
B has these vorteile and risk . what do you want to tun ?
And they say, &quot; doctor, what should I tun? &quot;
The doctor says, a has these vorteile and risks and b has these vorteile and risks.
What do you want to tun?
And if they say, &quot; if they were I, doctor, what would they do? &quot;
The doctor says, &quot; but I am not she. &quot;
Das ergebnis is -- we nennen es &quot; patient autonomy &quot; . das sounds like a good thing, but in reality it is a shift of the last of responsibility for the making of decisions by someone who knows something -- namely the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and most likely is sick and therefore not in the best constitution is a decision to make -- namely the patient.
There is an enormous marketing for prescription-obligatory drugs for people like you and me, that when they think about it, there is no mind making at all because we don’t buy them.
Why do we buy them if we can’t buy them?
The answer is: they wait for us to call the doctor next morning and to ask for a change in the prescription.
Something so deepgreifendes as our identity is now a frage der wahl, as this film should show.
We don’t inherit any identity, we inherit it.
And we induce ourselves as often as new as we want.
That means that one tag, when you wake up tomorrow, you have to decide what for an art of person you want to be.
In relation to marriage and family, there was a time in which the standard-acceptance war that almost everyone had one and that they married as quickly as they could, and then as quickly children get as they could.
The only true wahl war &quot; who &quot;, not when, and not was sie danach taten.
Nowadays it’s easy to have everything.
I teach wonderful intelligent students, and I give them 20 percent less work than I previously did.
And that’s not because they’re less intelligent, and not because they’re less careful.
It's because they're busy with other things, they're asking themselves, &quot; should I marry or not? should I marry now?
Should I get married later? should I first have children, or should I start a career? &quot;
They are all questioning questions.
And they will answer these questions regardless of whether that means all the tasks I do to them and no good note in my course to rise.
And in der Tat they should das tun. these are important to answering questions.
work -- we are gesegnet, as carl verdeutlicht hat, with the technology that uns enables every minute of any tag of any place on that planet to work -- up to the randolph hotel.
There is, of course, an ecke, of which I will not tell anyone, an der das wirelesslan works.
I’m not going to tell you because I’m using it will.
This incredible freedom of wahl we have in relation to work decisions to make, again and again and again, whether we should work or not should work.
We can watch our kindern while playing football, and we have our handy an der one hyfte, and our blackberry an other hyfte, and our laptop vermutlich on our shoß.
And even if they are all turned off, every minute in which we ask our child when stumbling a football game, we ask ourselves too, &quot; should I accept this call?
Should I answer this e-mail? should I write this letter? &quot;
And even if the answer to the frage &quot; no, &quot; is it will<unk> be their experience des fussballspiels ihres kindes prägen very different than it would have been.
Overall where we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle, living is a frage of the wahl.
And the world in which we lived saw so out.
That will I say, there were some wahl possibilities, but not everything was a frage of the wahl.
And the world in which we live now looks like that.
And the question is, are these good or bad news?
The answer is &quot; and &quot; .
We all know was good about it, so I’m going to be bad about it.
All of these options have two effects, two negative effects on humans.
One effect, paradoxer weise, is that it is lahmt instead of liberating.
With so many options out of the one man can choose, it’s very hard to decide at all.
I will give them another drastic example of this, a study of investments in volunteer alternate care.
A college of von Mir had access to the investment-acts of von Vanguard, the giant funding company of approximately one million collaborators and approximately 2,000 different jobs.
and was she fand war for 10 investment funds die der arbeitgeber anbot, nahm die participation um 2 per cent ab.
They offer 50 investment funds an -- 10 percent less employees take part than if they would only offer 5 investors. why ?
Because there are 50 investment funds that are to be selected, it’s so difficult to decide which one to choose that they will postpone it tomorrow.
And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow will, of course, not come.
They understand that it doesn’t just mean that people have to eat when they go in the rest, because they don’t have enough money to go back, it also means that decisions are so difficult to make that they miss large investment offers to their employers.
Through the non-participation they give up to 5000 US $ per year on by the employer who would have been happy to multiply their contribution.
LEMMUNG is a follicle of too many choice options.
I think it’s a sad thing that the world looks like that.
They want to make the decision really right, if it is for all eternity, right?
They don’t want the false investment fund to choose, or gar the false salatdressing.
The other effect is that even if we overcome the gap and make a decision, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than if we had the opportunity to have decided between less possibilities.
And there are several reasons for this.
One of them is bedingt by the large selection of different saladdressings, if they buy one, and it is not perfect -- and, which saladdressing is already perfect? it is simply forzustellen that they could have made another decision that would have been better. and what happened is this bildlich predestellte alternative leads to that they make the decision regret, and this regret affects negative on the satisfaction that they had from their gemachten decision, even if it was a good decision.
The more possibilities there are, the easier is it at all nothing to regret that is enttäuschend for the wahl they meet.
twitens, was economomen oppertunitätskosten nennen.
And Gilbert had a big point this morning by telling him how much the art in which we value things, depending on what we are comparing.
Well, if there are a lot of alternatives to bedenken there is it simply attractive properties vorzustellen of alternatives that they exclude, that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives that they have chosen.
For those of them who are not New Yorker, I apologize.
But here is what you should have thought about.
Here’s a couple on the hamptons.
Very expensive real estate.
Beautiful beach. great tag. you have it all for yourself.
was could be better ? &quot; verdammt &quot; der mann denkt , &quot; it is August .
Everyone in my manhattener Nachbarschaft is gone.
I could just park in front of my house. &quot;
and er spends 2 weeks from them gedanken verfolgt that is the possibility of verpasst hat, tag over tag, a great parking lot to have.
Oppertunity costs reduce the satisfaction that we receive through our selection, even if that was what we have selected is fantastic.
And the more options there are for the selection, the more attractive properties of this selection are taken into account in the upertunity cost.
Here is another example.
Now, this cartoon makes some aussagen.
It makes a phrase about it to live in now and<unk> even about it to slowly do things.
But one more important point, the power is: whenever you choose one thing, you decide not to do other things.
And these other things may have many attractive properties, and it will, what they tun will make less anziehend.
drittens: the escalation of expectations.
This has hit me when I wanted to exchange my jeans.
I trage jeans, fast the whole time.
And there was a time in which it was just jeans of an art gab, and they bought them, and they got badly fit, they were incredibly uncomfortable, and if they had been wearing them long enough and often washed enough, they began to feel &quot; ok &quot; to feel.
also went about new jeans to buy after a lot of jahren des tragens der alten, and I said, &quot; I would like to have a few jeans, here is my size. &quot;
And the seller said, &quot; want them schlanke, slightly concerned or weite?
Do you want knöpfe or reißverschluss? stone or saure gewaschen?
Do you want jeans with lochern?
I want you to go down far cut , kegelig , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so further tell you .
my kiefer was below and after I erholte I said, &quot; I would like the art, which before the only art war. &quot;
I didn’t know what the war was, so I spent an hour trying all these verdict jeans, and lost the business – and I know the truth – with the best fit jeans I had.
I had it better. all this choice was impossible for me to have it better.
But I feel worse.
I wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself.
der reason for that I felt worse war, with all these available possibilities, my expectations for it, was for a good pair of jeans, gingen high.
I had very low expectations. I didn’t have any concrete expectations, as they were only in one art.
If they were in 100 species, verdammt, one of them would have been perfect,
And was I bekam was good, but it was not perfect.
And so verglich I was what I got had to them what I expected, and what I had was enttäuschend in comparison to them what I expected.
The insufficiency of possibilities in the life of men is necessarily increased that expectations that men have about how good these possibilities will be.
And this leads to less satisfaction with the results, even if the results are good.
No one in the world of marketing knows this because, if they would, they would all know not what is going here.
The truth is more than the truth here.
The reason is, that before everything was better than everything was worse than everything was worse, that before everything was worse, that before everything was worse, that before everything was worse, that before everything was worse, that before everything was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse, that before it was worse.
Today, in the world in which we live — we prosperous, industrialized citizens, with perfection as an expectation — the best thing for which man can hope is that things are as good as man can expect from them.
They will not be angenehm surprised. because their expectations, my expectations, haushoch are.
The mystery of happiness – that’s what they’ve all come for – the mystery of happiness is low expectations.
I want to say -- a curzer autobiographischer moment -- that I am married to a woman, and she is really very wonderful.
I couldn’t have done it better.I didn’t have niedergelassen myself.
But not giving up is not always such a bad thing.
letztendlich, a folge des kaufens of a bad sitzenden jeans when there is only one art to buy is that if they are unhappy, and they wonder why, who is responsible, that answer is clear. the world is responsible. what would they have been able to tun?
If hundreds of different types of jeans are available, and they buy one that enttäuschend is, and they wonder why, who is responsible?
It is quite clear that the answer to this question is: she.
They could have better tuned it.
With 100 different types of jeans im schaufenster, there is no excuse for errors.
And so, when people make decisions, and even if the results of decisions are good, they feel disappointed, they blame themselves.
Clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.
I believe a significant—not the only, but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experienced that are disappointing because their standards are so high. and then, if they have to explain these experiences themselves, they think it would be their fault.
And so is the balance result that it is generally better, objective, and we feel worse.
Let me remind you.
This is the official dogma, which is one that we all think is right, is completely false, it is not true.
There is no phrase that some selection is better than no, but it follows not that more selection is better than some selection.
There’s a magical menge. I don’t know what it is.
I am quite sure that we have this point long verpasst have an out choice our common welfare improved.
Now, as a basic phrase — I bin fast fertig — as a basic phrase, which is the subject of the nachzudenken. das was all this choice enabled in the industrialized societies, is the material wealth.
There are many places in the world, and we have heard of many of them, whose problem is not the too large selection.
The problem is that they have too little.
Also the things about which I rede are a strange problem of the modern, rich, western societies.
and was so frustrierend and ergerlich is: Steve Levitt has told them gestern about how these teurer and hard to install childrenitze don’t help.
What I tell them is that these expensive, complicated decisions—it’s not easy, that they don’t help.
They even hurt.
They are worried that we are worse there.
If something of them would allow the people of our society to make such decisions to those societies in which men have too little choice would be postponed, it would not only improve the lives of men, but our lives would also be improved.
This is a pareto-verbesserungs application.
The distribution of the commodity will be concerned that it is better for all – not just the armen – because all this great selection plagues us.
abschließend, please read this cartoon, and, a highly developed person, says, &quot; ah! what knows this fish?
They know nothing is possible in this goldfischglas. &quot;
Verarmten fantasy, a short-looking view of the world—and that’s the art as I first read it.
The more I think about it, the more I get to the view that the fish knows something.
For the truth is that when they break the goldfish glass, so that everything is possible, they have no freedom.
If they break the goldfish glass, so that everything is possible, they break the satisfaction.
They strengthen the lymph and decrease the satisfaction.
Everyone needs a goldfish glass.
This is fast with complete safety too limited -- possibly even for the fish, definitely for us.
But das abhanden sein of a metaphorical goldfischglas is a recipe for elend, and, I vermute, catastrophe.
Thank you for vielmals.
They know, I’ve already spoken about some of these projects, about the human genom and what that could mean, and about the discovery of the new group of genes.
We actually start from a new point: we have digitalized the biology and now we are trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by forming and building new lives.
We have always tried to ask important questions.
What is life? is something, what I believe, that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different eques.
We have various approaches tried to simplify the minimum component.
We have almost 20 years digitalized . as we the human sequenzed have completed the change of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
Now we try to ask whether we can regenerate our lives or whether we can create new lives from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, mycoplasma geitalium, which possesses the smallest genom of a species that can replicate itself in labor, and we have tried if we can<unk> it with a smaller genom.
We have managed to give up about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here.
But if we look at this metabolic map, which is very simple, in comparison to our. trust me, that is simple. but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after the other, it is very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell.
Therefore, we have decided that it is the only way forward is this chromosome actually to synthesize was we allow the individual components to vary and thus put some of these fundamental questions.
And so we fingen an with the frage, can we synthesize a chromosome?
Does it allow the chemistry to create these really large molecules that were not yet made?
And, if we can, can we start the chromosome?
A chromosome is just a piece of inertes chemical material.
Our steps in the digitalization of the animals were exponential.
Our ability to write genetic code has developed very slowly but still gestigert . and our letzter point would now put on an exponential curve .
We started it 15 years ago.
It’s indeed a few jahre beginnend with a bioethical review before we made the first experiments.
As you find out, DNA synthesis is very difficult.
There are ten thousand machines around the world that small pieces of DNA can recover, 30 to 50 buchstaben long but it is a degenerative process, so the longer man a piece of power, the more errors pass.
So we had to develop a new method with which we could gather these small pieces and correct the errors.
Das war unser erster versuch, beginnend mit der digitalen information, des genoms phi x 174 .
It is a small virus that kills the bacteria.
We erstellten small pieces, made an error correction and had a DNA molecule of approximately 5,000 buchstaben.
The exciting phase came as we this piece of inerte chemical nahmen and in a bacterium gaben, and the bacterium begann the genetic code to read and made viral particles.
The viral particles were then released by the zellen and came back and killed by e. coli.
I recently talked to the beer industry and they told me that they are precisely aware of this model.
They laugh more than you are here.
So we think that there is a situation in which software actually can build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to go much further. we wanted a whole bacterial chromosome bauen. it has more than 580,000 buchstaben genetic code. so dachten wir uns, we bauen es in cassetten von der Größe des virus womit we die Größe der cassetten varieren could to understand what the individual components of a living cell are.
Design is the key, and if one starts with digital information in the computer will this digital information must really be error-free.
When we first sequenced the genom in 1995, the error rate was a error rate per 10,000 basenpaare.
If we had used the original sequence it would not have been possible to highzufahren.
A part of the designs is it, pieces to create the 50 buchstaben long and those with other 50 buchstaben pieces to overlap, to build smaller sub-units so that these match.
We have unique elements incorporated here.
You may have heard that we have built a watermark.
Think about it after : we have a 4 letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of these buchstaben—these buchstaben code about 20 amino acids; and here there is a single determination for each of these amino acids.
We can also use the genetic code to write our wörter, sentences, gedanken.
We have only signed the signatures.
Many people were disappointed that it was not a poetry war.
We have designed the pieces so that we could simply break them down with enzymes. there are enzymes that repair them and rebuild them again.
And we have angefangen to create pieces, starting with pieces that contained five to seven thousand letters, attach them to each other about 24,000 letters to make them gather again, up to 72,000.
In every step we have these pieces in excess produced so that we could sequence them because we tried a very robust process to create what they will see in a minute.
We have tried to get to the point of automation.
It looks like a basketball playoff.
If we get to these really large pieces — with over 100,000 basen pairs — then these will not simply grow in e. coli. it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology. and so we wand uns other mechanisms to.
We know of a mechanism called homologe recombination, which is the biology used to repair DNA, which can combine such pieces.
There is a organism named deinococcus radiodurans der drei millionen rad an strahlung overleht.
They see im oberen feld that their chromosome simply falls apart.
12 to 24 hours later, everything has come together again as it was.
We have thousands of organisms that can be tuned.
These organisms can be total ausgetrocknet, they can even live in the vacuum.
I am absolutely sure that life in the universe exists and can be moved, on the suche nach aquatischen conditions.
In fact, the NASA has shown that there are many of them out there.
Here is a gefügeadmission of the molecule that we have manufactured by using these proces - in fact we have only hefe-mechanisms used with the right design of the pieces we have it integrated . hefe adds these then automatically together .
That is not an electron microscope, it is a regular microscope.
It is so a large molecule that we can even see it with them a light microscope.
These are recorded over a duration of 6 seconds.
This is the publication that we have just recently completed.
It is the largest molecule with definierter structure that jemals von menschen was created.
It has a molecular weight of over 300 million.
If we were printed with a scripture size of 10 and without abstentions it would include 142 pages, only about this genetic code.
How do we start a chromosome? how do we activate it?
Obviously, it is very simple to deal with a virus. it is much more complicated to deal with bacteria.
It is even easier if man is in eukaryonten as we are tut: man simply takes the nucleus out and gives another in, and that’s exactly what they’ve all heard about the clone.
In archaebacteria, the chromosome in the cell is integrated, but only recently we have shown that one can carry out a complete transplantation of one chromosome from one cell to another and can activate it.
We reinigten the chromosome of a microbenspezies . grob said , these two are so far away from each other as human and mäuse . we gaben some extra-gen to that so we could choose this chromosome . we zersetzten it with enzymes about all proteins to destroy . and it was very surprising as we are in a zelle gaben -- and they will appreciate our very exhausted graphics here --
The new chromosome went into the cell.
In fact, we thought that here the end is, but we have tried to bring the process a little further.
This is the main mechanism of evolution here.
We find all species of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a drittes of anywhere, every time thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species hinzufügend.
Thus, humans who imagine evolution as a gene that will be changed at a time have lost a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes that restrictions enzymes are called that actually dna verdauen.
Das chromosom das in der zelle war hat keines; the chromosom that we have inserted already.
It was expressed in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material verdaute it and so we had in the end only one cell with a new chromosome.
It was colored blue because of the genes we had inserted.
And after a very short time it had all the characteristics of the species lost and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we in the zelle have given.
All the proteins changed the membranes changed — as we the genetic code lasen, it was exactly what we transferred.
It may be like genomische alchimie klingen, but we can, by spanning the software-dna, things quite dramatically change.
Now I have argued that this is not the genesis -- that is based on 3.5 billion jahren evolution.
And I have argued that we may be in the process of creating a new form of the kambry explosion in which it could be massive new art formation based on this digital design.
Why should we do the tun?
I think it’s quite obvious in the sight of what we need.
We are now growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years.
I was born in 1946, and I was born in 1946.
Today there are three human beings on this planet for one der im jahr 1946 existed hat; within 40 years it will be four.
We have problems with nutrients, with fresh and clean wasser, medicine, fuel for 6.5 billion people.
It will be a challenge that I will offer for 9.
We need more than five billion tons of coal, 30-plus a billion fester beans. that are hundred million fester am tag.
If we think about biological procees or any process to replace that, it will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, there is the whole CO2 of this material that is in the atmosphere land.
We now have, from our discoveries from all over the world, a database with approximately 20 million genes, and I want to believe that these are the design components of the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen components and they see the diversity an the daraus entstand .
We stand here in erster line on the boundaries of biological reality and on the boundaries of our imagination.
Today we have technology due to this fast synthesemethoden, which is why we call combinatory genetics.
We now have the possibility a big robot to build the million of chromosomes on the tag can recover.
If you imagine these 20 million different genes herzustellen or these proces to optimize about oktan herzustellen or medically new impurities, we can with a small team change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science.
and it is only nurmale selection. we can select according to viability, production of chemicals or fuel production pollutant production and so on.
This is an encounter of real design-software an der wir arbeiten, with which man actually sit and new species am computer design kenn.
They know, we don’t necessarily know how it will look. we know exactly how their genetic code will look.
We are now focusing on treibstoffe of the fourth generation.
They have recently seen but zu ethanol was just a bad experiment is.
We have second- and third-generation treasures that will relatively soon come out that will have much higher sugar levels, such as oktan or different types of butanol.
But, as we think, the only art that makes biology a great influence without further increasing the cost of nutrients or the limitation of their availability will be when we see CO2 as the primary material, and therefore we work on cells that go this way.
And we think we will be the first with fuel of the fourth generation, and that in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 are one method --
But in our discovery of the world, we all have different types of methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
er lebt in der tiefsee, approximately one and a half miles deep, at nahezu kochenden wassertemperatures.
Es wandelt CO2 in methane um under the use of hydrogen as an energy source.
We can underline whether we can use stored co2 which could easily be brought to production sites, convert the co2 into fuel, in order to drive this process.
Within a short time span we believe, we could be in the lage to be one of the basic questions of life to solve.
They know, we really have -- moderate ziele like them replacement of the entire petrochemical industry . exactly . if you can't do it at ted tun , where else ? to become a main source of energy .
But precisely we are currently working on using the same approaches for the development of pollutants.
They’ve seen this jahr with the flu, we’re always a jahr and have a dollar too little when it’s about the right smoke goes.
I think that it can be changed by creating a rekombinant impfstoffe in vorhinein.
As the future might seem with changes, the evolution tree can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria, archaen, and possibly eukaryonten.
Our soul is it just that we have a chance long enough to survive to that possibly to tun.
At the last ted conference I gave an introduction to the LHC .
And I promised to come back to explain to them how the machine works.
Now it is so far, and for all those damals that were not there, the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment that has been engaged — 27 kilometers through.
His task is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionst seconds after the beginning of the universe—and that up to 600 million times within a second.
It is just atemberaubend ehrgeizig.
This is the machine under the genf.
We take pictures of this mini-urknalle in detectoren on .
Atlas detector - 44 meters in the width, 22 meters in the doormesser.
Here is a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so that they can see the size proportions.
On September 10, letzen jahres loved the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by atlas.
Es verursachte immensen jubel im controlraum.
It is a picture of the first strahlenparticels which the whole strike um den lhc returns, then intentionally collides with a part des lhc, in order to leave a regen of particles on the detector prasseln.
In other words, when we saw this image on September 10, we knew that the machine works, which is a great triumph.
I don't know, whether this is the greatest jubel erzeugte, or this, when someone that google site visited and the home page so vorfand.
It means that we have a cultural influence alongside the scientific achieved.
About a week later there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wheels here—this golden wheels here—this gold wheels here.
These wheels run 13 thousand ampere when the machine runs at high power.
Now, the engineers among them will look at them and say, &quot; nein das tun sie nicht.
They can do that because if you cool them very far, they will become so-called supraleitern.
at minus 271 degrees also, cold as the space between the sternen, these wheels can sustain the voltage.
In one of the connections, between over neuntausend magneten im lhc, gab is a manufakturdefect.
dadurch erhitzen the wire geringfügig and 13-thousand ampere begegneten suddenly electrischem widerstand .
This was the ergebnis.
Now, everything is even more impressive when you imagine that the magnets weigh more than 20 tons and move around about 30 cm.
We damaged also approximately 50 der magneten
And we had to remove them, what we had to do.
We conditioned them, repaired them.
They are all back on their way.
At the end of March, the LHC will be functional again.
We will connect it, and wait for the first daten in June or July to be able to gather, and put our journey fort, um herauszufinden was the bausteine des universums are.
nun, of course, on an art entfachen such accidents again the debate um den Wert von Wissenschaft und Ingenieurkunst an solchen grenzen. it is easy, so something abzulehnen.
I think the tatsache that it’s so hard, the tatsache that we over our boundaries out greifen, forms the value of things like them lhc.
Humphrey davy, who, as I vermute, as er the nutzlosen experiments seines lehrlings verteidigte, his lehrling war Michael Faraday, said as follows: &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirits, as anzunehmen, that our scientific conceptions are endgültig, that there is no mystery in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there is no new welten to erobern. &quot;
A lot of thanks.
I am a writer.
The book to write is my beruf, but it is of course more than that.
It is also my great, life-long love and fascination.
I don’t expect that this will change.
However, curzliche is something strange in my life and my career, which has led me to completely overthink my bezug to this work.
This peculiar erections were that I recently wrote a book – a biography named “ eat, pray, love” – that, decisively different than all my previous books from any reason in the world outgoing and a great mega-ereignis, international bestseller-ding became.
The ergebnis is that I, no matter where I come, will be treated as if I were undergoing them.
Seriously – they fall down!
For example, they come very concerned about me and say, &quot; do you not fear that they will never be overcome this success?
They have no fear that they will continue to write their whole life and not again create a book that interests anyone in the world, not again?”
Well, the power is really mut.
It would, however, be worse if I didn’t remember that I was over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager for the first time told that I wanted to be a writer, with the same art of angstbesetzter reaction being confronted.
The people say, “Do you have no fear of not having any success?
Do you have no fear that the deformation of an absage will hurt you?
Do you have no fear that you will follow this handwork your life long and nothing will arise from it, and that you will die on a shrotthaufen of dreams – your mouth filled with the bitter asche of versages?”
Approximately, you already know.
The short answer to all these questions is: “Yes.”
I am afraid of all these things.
And I always had it.
And I’m afraid of a lot more of things that no one would get rid of.
like algen – and other horrible things.
But if it’s about writing, I’m thinking about it for a short time and wondering: why?
Is that reasonable?
Is it logical that someone should be expected that er angst davor hat, that work to tun to that er feels called?
And what exactly is it with the creative undertakings that they make us uncertain about the mutual state of mind – in one art, how do others not do it?
My father, for example, was a chemist and I can an no situation in his 40 years as a chemist erinnern, in which he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist.
mit deiner chemiker-blockade , john – how does it go &apos;s say with it ?
It’s just not going to go, you know?
But to be fair – the group of chemists have over the centuries not received the reputation of alcoholic manic-depressive men.
We writers seem to have this art of ruf, but not only the writers, but the creative all genres, seem to have this ruf, to be mentally unstable.
Everything they have to do is, the bitter todeszahlen of truly great köpfen alone from the 20th century anzusehen, the jung and often from their own hand die.
And even those who aren’t actually begingen suicide, seem to be really neglected by their talent.
Norman Mailer said kurz before his tod in his last interview: “Each of my books has killed me a little further.”
It is an extraordinary phrase that you can do over your lifework.
But we don’t even shock when we hear someone say something like this, because we know this art of aussagen for so long time. somehow we have the auffassung so verinnerly and collectively accepted that creativity and leads somehow naturally come together and that art – at the end – always leads to the seelenqual.
The question that I want to ask everybody here today is: is this idea perfectly in order for you?
Because with just one centimeter distance viewed ... I feel not well with this auffassung at all.
I find her abscheulich.
And I find her dangerous. and I will not see how she will be taken over in the next century.
I find it better if we live our great creative ermuntern.
And I know definitely that it would be very dangerous for me – in my situation – to begin this dark pfad of vermutation sozusagen herunterzusickern – especially in the circumstances in which I am just in my career.
I’m pretty jung, I’m just about 40 years old.
I may have another 40 years of work in me.
And it’s extremely likely that everything I’m writing from now on will be written by the world as the work will be assessed, that after the abgefahrenen success of my last book kam, right?
I say it is right, because we are here and now all somehow friends – it is highly likely that my greatest success lies behind me.
Oh, Jesus, what a thought!
That’s the art of thinking that can bring someone to start at 9 a.m. morning, to drink gin, and that’s what I don’t want.
I would rather continue this work that I love.
So the question is: how?
After a time of reflection, it seems to me that in order to continue to write, I have to develop an art of schützendem psychological structure.
Sometimes I have to find a way when I write to maintain a secure distance between me and my very natural discretion about how the reaction to the written will be.
While I’ve been looking for models in the past year to do so, I’ve also been looking in the past and I’ve tried to find other societies to see if they possibly had better or more reasonable ideas about it than we, how you can help creatively, deal with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity.
This suche led me into the ancient Greekland and the ancient Rome.
Please follow me, for the cross will be closed again.
But in the ancient Greece and Rome, the men did not believe that creativity of men comes, okay?
They believe that creativity is an art of divine diener-geist war, which comes from a distant, unknown what to the human – from unexplicable, unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these divine diener-geister of creativity “demonen” .
Von Sokrates is known that er daran glaubte, er would have a devil, who did not tell him the wisdom of further ferne.
The Romans had the same idea, called this art of the bodyless creative spirit a “genius”.
The Romans did not really think that a genius was a<unk> intelligent individual.
They believed that a genius was this art of magical divine essence, and they believed that it was sprichwörtlich in the wander of an artist atelier lebt – about as dobby, the hauself – the rauskäme and that the artist in the work was somewhat invisible assisted and the ergebnis of the work would be formed.
Das ist brilliant – Das ist es, Das ist die Distanz, von der ich sprach – Das psychologische Konstrukte, which protects you from den folgen deiner arbeit.
And everyone knew it worked so, right?
Der Künstler des Altertums war vor gewissen things protected, such as, zum beispiel, too much narcissism, right?
If your work was brilliant, you could not see everything for you verbuchen. everyone knew that you had this bodyless genius, that says geholfen has.
If your work flopped – not completely your mistake, right?
Everybody knew that your genius was a bit lazy.
Thus, the people in the West have really long thought about creativity.
And then came the Renaissance and everything changed. we had this great idea. and this great idea was: let us the human individual be placed in the center of the universes – over all the götter and mystery. and there is no room for mysterious creatures, which will be accepted by the divine.
It is the beginning of the rational humanism and the people begin to believe that creativity is completely from their own individual.
For the first time in history, people hear this or that artist call a genius – instead of saying that it is a genius.
I have to say to them, I think that was a big mistake.
I think, to allow a single person to think, to think, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know, to know.
It’s like asking someone to sweat that sleep.
That entstellt and verzerrt the whole ego and it erzeugt all these unrealisable expectations on the success.
I think that this success-print our artists of the last 500 years has vernichtet.
And, if it is right – and I think it is right – it is the phrase:
Can we change it?
Per<unk> to a alterthematic understanding of the relationship between man and the mystery of the creative.
Per<unk> not.
Per<unk> we can the gedankengut aus 500 jahren rational humanism not simply in a 18-minute vortrag auslöschen.
And there are<unk> men in this audience, who would report truly legitimate scientific doubts about the representation of – fundamentally – feen, which people follow and feenzauber on their projects, etc. use.
I will probably not be able to take all of them with me on this journey.
But the question that I will raise is: why not?
Why not think so about it?
Because it makes the same much of the mind as anything else, of whom I have heard, when it was darum ging, which is absolutely mad machende the launenity of the creative processes to explain.
A process that – as everyone knows, where it has tried to do something – also in other words: in fact everyone here – does not always behave reasonably.
Sometimes you can feel paranormal.
I recently had a such encounter as I the extraordinary American poet Ruth stone traf, who now is over 90, who but her whole lives long dicterin was. she told me that she as she in the gate virginia rises out on the feldern works. she said, she would feel and hear like a poem about the landscape on her zukäme.
She said it would be like a donor zug out of air,
It would be overwhelming over the land on them.
She felt when it was kam, for it would bring the herd under her mouths to the baby.
She knew that in a dark moment she could only one tun. and the war – in her words – “run like the devil.”
She ran like the devil to the house while she was persecuted by this poem. it went only darum that she had to gather quickly enough to a blatt paper and a stift, so that she could, if it was through her hindurch give, inhangen and fix on that blatt.
She ran and ran and ran, but she reached the house not and the poem rolled through her hindurch and she missed it. she said it would go further over land and – as she said – “seek another poet.”
And then there were those moments – the part I will not forget – she said that there were obvious moments in which she was fast missed.
Also: she runs to the house and seeks for them paper and the poem fährt through her hindurch and she greift a stift just as it is through her hindurchgeht and then – she said – it was as if it would with her other hand danach greifen and it is to packen kriegen.
She erwischte das Gedicht an his schwanz and zog it back in her body and overnahm it on the blatt paper.
At these occasions, I got the poem perfectly and intact on that paper an – but backward – from the last wort to the first.
As I hear, I think, “this is unheimlich – that’s exactly how my creative process follows.”
That’s not like my creative process – I’m not the channel!
I am a maultier. um to be able to work I have one tag to the same time to wake up and switzen, me abmühen and really unpleasant through.
But even I in my maultierart have sometimes this ding gestreift.
I think many of them have gotten it too.
I had myself work or ideas, which came from one which through me hindurchkamen, which I really cannot identify.
What is that for a thing?
And how can we thus get in a relationship without losing our mind, but rather keeping ourselves in the opposite even with spiritual health?
For me is the best living example, how man can create this can the musician tom waits. i durfte him before a few jahren for a magazine interview.
We are talking about this topic. and they know what was? the most time of their lives was tom the verkörperung of the gepeinigten modern artists, who tried, these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in it, to dominate and deal with them.
But then he became older and quieter. he told me that there was a tag on a fast road in the angels fuhr. and then everything changed for him.
er fuhr with high speed as er suddenly a small fragment of a melody hears, which, as it is with inspiration often is, for him quälend hard greifbar is. and er will she have. she is prachtvoll. er lechzt danach, but er can she not fassen.
er has no piece of paper, er has no stift, er has no cassette record.
“I will lose this ding and will be persecuted by this song forever.
I’m not good enough, I can’t do it.”
But instead of panicing, just stop.
You’re beendete the whole gedankengang and made something completely new.
He just looked in the sky and said, “Sorry, you can’t see that I’m driving the car?”
“Do I feel as if I could just write a song?
If you really exist willst, come to a more affordable moment again, if I can take care of you.
If not, then someone else today.
“Go and what Leonard Cohen.”
His ganzer workprocess has changed.
Not the work itself. the war continued often as dark as eh and je.
But the process and the heavy confusion, which surrounds him, was removed as er das genie aus sich heraus nahm, where er nothing but erger verursachte and him dahin left back where er sozusagen herkam. er acknowledged that it was no verinnerlichtes, quälendes ding must be.
It could have a proper, wundersame, bizarre collaboration, an art conversation between Tom and the fremdartigen, external ding, which was not completely Tom war.
When I heard this story I have changed it also a bit the art, how I work and it has saved me once.
I believe in one of these gruben des doubles in which we all fall, if we an something work and it does not klappt. you fängst an to think that it will be a disaster. that will be the worst book, that you have been written.
Not only bad, but also the worst of all time.
I begin to think, I should just unstamp this project.
But then I remembered how Tom in the free sky had spoken, and I tried it.
I hob also my blick vom manuscript and sprach my comment in direction of a leeren ecke des raums .
I sprach loud: “ hear zu, du ding, you and I know both, if this book is not brilliant, that it is not complete my fault, right?
For you see me, that I invest everything I have, I have no more than that.
If you’re also better to have willst, you have to cross up here and keep your anteil der abmachung.
Well, but, if you don’t thust... know you was, then to the devil with it.
I’m going to continue writing because that’s my job.
And I would like to please give to the protocol that I am today for my part of the jobs here was.”
For ... am end is it as follgt. vor jahrhunderten have in the western northern African men to mondscheinfesten with holy tänzen and music combined, which were held for hours – until morgendämmerung.
These celebrations were always great, because the tänzer were professional and they were fantastic.
But again and again, very rarely, something special happened. one of the actors was actually overworldly.
And I know that they know what I mean, because I know that they all have seen such a work once in their lives.
It was as if the time stillstehen and the tänzer through an art pforte treeten. er tat nothing but er es je zuvor getan hat – 1000 views zuvor. but everything figured together.
And suddenly it appeared is no longer pure human.
It was enlightened from within and enlightened from below, and everything was enlightened through a divine fire.
When such a damals happened, they knew the people were the war; they called it by his name.
They lay their hands together and began to sing, “Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.”
This is a good thing, you know?
The pronunciation changed in the loop of the centuries of “Allah, Allah, Allah” to “olé, olé, olé”, that man still hear at stierkampfen and flamenco-tänzen.
If a speaker in Spanish has something impossible, something magical getan: “Allah, olé, olé, Allah, great, bravo” unfassbar, then it is: a flüchtiger look at god.
And that’s great because we need it.
But, the knifflige part follows the next morning, when the tänzer himself rises and realizes that it is 11 hours on a day – and it is no longer a fünkchen of God carries in itself.
He is just a alterner sterblicher with a painful knien, and maybe he will never rise to this height again.
And maybe no one will call the name of God again, if he is dreht. but what should he then start with them rest his lives?
That’s hard.
This is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life.
But maybe it doesn’t have to be so voller pein if you from the beginning have not believed that the exceptionalest aspects of their daseins are coming from them.
If they may just believe that they are a leihgabe – from an unimaginable quelle for an erlesene time their lives, which will be transmitted to someone else when they are ready to do so.
When we start, so thinking about it, it changes everything.
So I have begun to think and so I think with certainty in the past months, while I an dem buch work, that soon will appear – as the dangerous, frightening, strongly expected nachfolger meines abgefahrenen sucks.
What I have to say to myself constantly, when I get crazy about it, is: there is no fear.
Don’t be enthusiastic.
Just do your job.
You will continue to be for your contribution, no matter what it is.
If your job is to dance, dance.
If the dumme divine genius, which is put to the seite, decides to show for a short moment a hauch of wunder through your effort, then “olé!”
And if not, tanze dennoch your dance.
And “Ole!” for you despite alledem.
I believe in it and I have the feeling that we should learn.
“Ole!” for you despite alledem, just for that you have the blouse human love and the ownership, for that you are there.
Thank you .
Thank you .
Oh oh oh oh!
letztes jahr I have shown these two follicles to be veranschaulichen that the Arctic eiskappe, which for approximately three million years the size of the under 48 states had, is about 40 percent shrumpft.
but this does not press strong enough the seriousness of this special problem out, since it does not show the dicke of the eises.
In a certain sense is the Arctic eiskappe das schlagende herz of our global climate systems.
She grows in winter and shrumpft in summer.
The next film, which I show them, is a zeitrafferaufnahme was in the last 25 years passed.
Das dauereis is marked with rot.
This is the annual eis in winter; and it is shrumpft in summer.
The so-called dauereis, five jahre alt or older, is beinahe like blut, which out of the body here outfliesst.
In 25 years, it will disappear from here to here.
This is a problem, since the heating den gefrorenen grund um den arktischen ocean optaut, in them is a large mix of gefrorenem carbon, which, if it is optaut, is implemented from microbes to methane.
Compared to the total percentage of climate-changing substances in the atmosphere, this percentage could double itself if we exceed this critical point.
already today sprudelt in some flachen seen in alaska methan von selbst aus dem wasser .
Professor katey walter der universität in alaska is with another work group to another flachen see last winter gereist .
Wow wow!
The question is, how will it be wrong to us.
And one reason is, this enormous heat storage warms Greenland from the north.
This is an annual tauwasserfluss.
But the volume is significantly greater than the volume.
This is the kangerlussuaq fluss in southwestern Greenland.
If you want to know how the moreesspiegel by landisschmelze steigt here fliesst she ins more.
These flows take fast up.
Am other ende des planets, the Antarctic, the largest eismasse on the planet.
Last month meldeten forscher that the entire continent now has a negative ice balance.
And the westantarctis, which is opened over a couple of underwater islands, is<unk> strong in the smooth.
This is equal to 20 feet moreeshöhe, like Greenland.
im himalaya, der drittgrössten eismasse, see them up new seen, which were before a couple of jahren gletscher.
40 percent of all humans in the world get the half of their drinkwater from this schmelzwasser.
In the second, this gletscher is the drinkwater source for this city.
The wassermengen has grown up.
But if they are versioned, the majority of the drinking water will also fall away.
In California, a 40 percent reduction of the schneedecke der sierra was seen.
This applies to the speicherbecken.
And the forecasts, as they have read them, are serious.
This dehydration throughout the world leads to a dramatic steigerung an feuern.
And the disasters everywhere in the world have grown in a truly extraordinary and previously unprecedented ausmass.
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 years.
This is a completely unstoppable development pattern.
If you look at this in the historical context, you can see what is anrichtet.
in the last 5 years we have 70 millionen tons of CO2 produced every 24 hours -- 25 millionen tons of one tag in the ocean.
Look at the area of the eastern Pacific exactly an, from the American continent westlich and beiderseits of the Indian subcontinents, where there is a drastic decline in the acid in the sea.
The biggest individual factor for the global warming, in addition to the abholzung, which is 20 percent off, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Beer is a problem, and beer is the biggest problem.
The united states are one of the two largest verschmutzer, along with China.
And the proposal was, many more coffee factory to be built.
But we begin to see a change.
Here are the ones, which in the last years were gestrichen, with some green alternatives, which were proposed.
There is a political conflict in our country.
And the coffee industries and the beer industries have spent a viertelmillion dollars in the last calendar year, to promote the cleaner coffee, which in itself is already a widerspruch in itself.
This picture reminds me of something.
On Christmas herum liefen, at me zu hause in Tennessee, a billion tons of kohleschlamm out.
They have seen it warscheinlich in the news.
This is in our entire country the second-largest abfallfluss in America.
This happened at a Christmas day.
One of the werbespots of the kohle industry was this.
Frosty der Kohlenmann is a vergnügter, fröhlicher bursche.
It exists in hülle and fülle in America, and it is the help of our economy to grow.
frosty, der kohlenmann will be one tag sauberer.
is free and loving, and works remain in lohn and brot.
This is the one of the most kohle in west Virginia.
The most powerful bergarbeiter is the leiter of massy coal.
Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don’t know, what they say.
Also has the alliance for climate protection two campaigns ins life called.
This is one, a part of it.
We see climate change as a serious danger to our business.
That’s why we’ve put ourselves at the top, to spend a substantial amount of money to bring a advertising action to the way, to the truth over the coal.
Tatsache is, Kohle is not dreckig.
We believe, she’s clean – and smells even good.
So don’t worry about climate change.
Let them be quiet for us.
Saueber Kohle, you’ve heard a lot of it.
Also let us make a tour of this modern, clean coffee factory.
Fantastic! this machine is quite dry.
But it is the clang of clean cohletechnology.
And yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for the global warming, which significantly clean coal technology that you see here, changes everything.
This is the present, cleaner cohletechnology.
Finally, the positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.
America is in a crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The rote faden, which connects all of this, is our dependence on carbon-based power substances such as dreckige kohle and foreign beer.
But now there is a brave, new solution, to release us out of this miserable failure.
Versorge America mit 100 % sauberer electricity neu, within the next 10 years
A plan to bring America back to work, to make us safer and to help stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is large enough to solve our problems.
Now you’re in America, you’ll find more.
This is the last.
It’s about a negligence from America.
One of the fastest ways, to reduce our dependence on old, dreckigen power substances, which destroy our world.
The future is here: wind, sun, and a new energy system.
New investments to create well-free jobs.
Versorge America neu. it is time, reality to accept.
There is an altes African sprichwort : &quot; if you fast be desirest, go alone.
If you want to come far, go together. &quot;
We have to go far, and it is fast.
A lot of thanks.
I want to begin with them to bite, to reflect on their kindness when they play with bauklötzen.
While they realized how to stretch and access the hand, the clothes take and move, they actually learned to overthink and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial connections.
The spatial thinking is eng connected to how we understand a large portion of our environment.
As a computer scientist - inspired by the art of our interaction with real objects - together with my expert patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi, I began to wonder: what would be if we would use the computer, which instead of a maus-zeigers, which moves like a digital fingerspitze on a flache workplace ... ... what would be if we could interfere with both hands and daten physically ergreifen and they could so organize how we want it?
This frage war so ergreifend that we uns zur erforschung der antwort decided and siftables developed.
In short, a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a cake.
They can be moved with the hand, they can perceive each other, they can capture their movements, and they have a screen and a funkemphenger.
Much more important: they are physical, which is why you can move them like bauklötze only through the outskirts of the hand and access to them.
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of hilfsmitteln zur manipulation digitaler daten.
And when these helpers become more physical and develop a consciousness of their movements, recognize each other and perceive the subtles of our relationship with them, then we can start with the exploration of new and fun interactions.
I’m fange with a few simple<unk>.
This siftable is configured for the video edition and if I put it in a direction of kippe, the video vorwärts will be abgespielt; if I put it in the other direction of kippe, it will run back.
And these interactive portraits take each other into reality.
If I also do not lease them with each other, the interest of them will weckt.
When you’re surrounded by voneinader, you notice that too and you can get somewhat nervous.
And they feel ebenso their movements and inclination.
An interesting folge of interactions that we begin to recognize was that we could use everyday gestures on daten, such as colour so to shut, how man does this with fluids.
In this case we have three siftables as a color set and I can use them, um color in den in der nicht zu gießen, wo they then will be mixed.
If we exaggerate it, we can restore a little.
There are also some clear possibilities in the formation such as speech, mathematics or logic games, where we den leuten give the possibility of the fast outprobierens and the results want to be seen immediately.
Here bin I ... that's a fibonacci-folge that I create with a simple equation program.
This is a game with wörtern, which is an art mixing from scrabble and boggle.
Basically, man gets every round on one siftable randomly zugewiesene buchstaben and while man tries to form a wörter, this will be verified over a wörterbook.
Then, after about 30 seconds, it is mixed again and man has a new buchstaben combination and new possibilities to try out.
A lot of thanks.
There are a few kids who are on an excursion to the media lab. I could move them, try it out and have taken a video of it.
You have really loved it.
An interesting circumstance in this art of applications is that man den leuten doesn’t have to give many instructions.
Everything you need to say is &quot; picture wörter &quot; and they know exactly what to tun is.
Here are a few more people who are testing.
This is our beta-tester here to the bottom right.
It found out that it was the siftables just stapeln wanted.
So for him they were just bauklötze.
This is an interactive trickfilm application.
We want to develop a learning tool for sprachlerner.
This is Felix.
er can bring new characters into the scene, by being the siftable from the table lifted, where this figure shows.
This is where the sun rises.
The dream comes up.
Now holt is a tractor in the scene.
The Orange Tractor.
Good work! yes!
Through the er the siftables shüttelt and she nebed each other legt can er the characters interact...
Her own history is inherited.
Hello Hello !
It is a story with open end and it can decide how it develops.
The Flying Cat.
The last example, for which I today have time, is to show, is a music-sequencer for live-auftritte, which we have recently developed and in them siftables as töne, as lead, bass and schlagzeug act.
Each has four different variations; one can choose which one wants to use.
And man can eat this tune in the sequence, which man again in any pattern can arrange.
And man speist them one, by simply holding a ton-siftable an a sequence-siftable.
There are effects that man can live change, such as hall and filter.
Man connects it with a certain tone and then tends to set it up.
And then yet overwhelming effects such as time and sea strength, which man applies to the entire sequence.
Let’s look badly too.
We begin, in them we die führungsstimme in two sequenz-sifftable inspeisen and these in a reihe anordnen, they erweitern and a little more of the stimme inspeisen.
Now I’m adding a bass hints.
Now I’m going to get a little bit more of it.
And now verbinde i den filter with the schlagzeug so that I den effect live steuern can.
I can accelerate the whole sequence by accelerating the time in the one or the other direction of kippe.
And now I connect the filter yet with the bass; for a little more expression.
I can change the sequence while you are moving.
Through this I must not plan it in vorfeld, but can improvisate it; it can extend or shorten it during time.
and abschließend I can the whole sequence ausblenden, by making the lautstärke-siftable nach links neige.
A lot of thanks.
As you can also see, my enthusiasm lies in developing new human-computer-interfaces that fit them better as our minds and bodies work.
And today I had time to show them a part of this new design-world and some of the possibilities to show what we work in our laboratory.
The idea that I want to give them on the way is that we stand an der schwelle to this new generation of werzeugen to interact with the digital media that brings informationen to our world that meets our needs.
A lot of thanks,
I am looking forward to the conversation with you all!
A good tag.
I am glad that I am there.
So, what should biohacking be?
I have to get a little bit out of it, and I am engaged in biohacking just with the modern molecular biology.
I’m studying molecular biology and I’m engaged right now for a few years with them biohacking, and that’s what I started because I just wanted to know more and it’s above all wanted to do myself, what I so studied theoretically learned.
That was my primary motivation.
also it was a neugier and I wanted somehow closer ran an the matter, so.
I think that the molecular biology is in general now, also in general spoken, biotechnology, everything, what man counts, synthetic biology, and so on.
It’s extremely important, it’s already extremely important, and much more, much more important will be in the future.
There are so umstrittene things like this whole genetically altered pflanzen on the äckern.
There is now craig waiting in den u.s.a, der tried biofuel herzustellen, also petrol aus algen.
Under then there are also already things that total im alltag are angekommen, what the majority of people but not conscious, for example, waschmittelenzyme, which allows us to wash, with vierzig degree wash to wash, are also genetically optimized enzymes.
And the list can continue endlessly.
And so, because of their interest in this, in this technology, I am just going to continue to reintroduce.
So why is it hacking now?
Most people know the most people know the most people know the most people know the most people.
computer hacken, and then it will be in the media always so, yes, that hacker breaks somewhere a and klauen daten and so on.
That’s and somehow for the hackerszene very sad, because that’s not the trifft, what they actually like that’s actually angefangen had and what actually dahinter stands.
They have the software-hacker, in the siebziger, achtzigerjahren with computerbasteln angefangen and therefore is also the internet entstanden.
And it’s going on, with a playful, creative, original art, a problem to solve.
and problem, that is not only a technical problem, it can also be a social problem, it can also simply be a access problem, what is how things make it easier, such as any problem pose, a phrase to raise, and how can you do it differently, or how can you do it better.
And it was just it is halt with software grandgeworden, but there is also in the electronic area, since there is also a whole bastlerszene, which with electronicschaltkreisen all possible abgefahrenen things do.
And now just stop also in the direction of biology, and then I want to take this metaphor, which stops from synthetic biology, that biology is actually an information science, because, the d.n.a code is an abstract code, that yes, it is not quite the same as a computer, because it is more dynamic, because it is matter, so real matter is, and not just cyber.
But it’s also a code, and it can also program and accordingly it can also hack, so, and that fand I find I incredibly fascinating, and then I just wanted to be much deeper with the same.
Das hat actually only two thousand eight really form accepted, this network.
Since there is hackteria dot org, that is originally from Switzerland, that is with Europe and with a cooperation in indien basiertes netzwerk, that is now a member or active people everywhere on the world has.
There are many artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists engaged in this, just to interact with these technologies and to ask questions and to process the creative, there are museum exhibitions and yes, everything possible.
But it’s really always possible to find such a lockeren access, such a playful engagement with it.
And then there is do-it-yourself-bio dot org, d.i.y.bio.
Das ist aus den u.s.a a netzwerk, that is actually more so a art forum, where you are where you stand to meet and discuss online.
They are a bit more technically oriented and also a bit more business-sized on the way, then they are then also so, and angewandte questions put.
and out of these networks, which have made the whole popular, has stopped developing such a scene that I would like to portray shortly.
here im image links above sees man biocurious, that is a hack space, also im principle an art school, so a private school, gemeinnützige verein establishment, where everyone can income.
Kids, other, all possible people go there, in order to simply interact with it, they have a lab set up and look at what can man do if this lab protocol is an.
here links below is a group in Indonesian , house-of-natural-fibers means die , which exists but already quite long .
It has been longer than the other two networks.
They also engage in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and, yes, also electronics, and combine them on quite abgefahre art.
A group from Ankara, which I have before a long time badly acquainted, which have that is a student group, which would like to give the public more vermitteln, what they learned in the union, and which have so on the street festival made small actions and people tried to explain what d.n.a. is.
And I have above in on the other picture a vorlesung in in Copenhagen im medical museum in combination with an exhibition on the theme.
And it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is, and it is.
And what can you do with it, and just very specifically to the society, to approach it and to ask, so, okay, what do you know, what do you want to join, do you have an interest in bringing you into it so?
So, o.k, for now biology to hack, it needs man and somehow material.
You naturally need biological materials, but you also need tools, and that is then a laboratory.
either, what is normally under a labor understood, that are so somehow abgefahrene maschinen, extremely expensive, extremely distanced, only for fachpersonal, ausgebildete academic with doctortitel and so on.
And our approach was just ceasing to say, ok, that you really don’t have to do that.
That’s really not necessary because every one every coffee machine has actually higher developed technology than most laboratory devices, that’s really so.
and s o with this prémisse with this prémisse has then for example brian degger in England tried, a minimallabor zusammenzustellen, has then so a dampfdruckkochtopf genommen, a heizplatte and, yeah, so suppenbrühe, and has thus thus bakterien gezüchtet, function.
So everyone, who has once been a snorkeled soup, which has been too long standing, has already done badly.
I had that then in my labor daheim tried, a little outsuiten, and I then stopped so second-hand-equipment on ebay bought and a little d.n.a analysis done, tried, a test of vatership, so so so so / d.n.a fingerprinting, still bad to do daheim.
It shouldn’t be a joke now, but.
here down in them picture sees man is the labor, in anführungsstrichen, so is so a zugestellte garage with also so all possible laborgerümpel, den die uni ausgemistet hat, a group in Paris, which is da was was set up has and quite successful with it is and also quite interesting stuff power, so will I also even a project short-need.
and that here is biocurious, that is also mentioned hack space, this yes, so an art volkshochschule im principle for molecular biology.
And yes, also, you see, it is relatively relatively heterogeneous, so there is a stop of people who make the alone home, until the bigger also larger organizations, which have a stop of the more formal also already in the institutionalizer form already operate.
But it is always the attitude that it should be easy and accessible.
The first project that we have done as an international group, when we almost became aware of ourselves, etc, there are now here as a real scene too, and we are online, and we know so the people, who always chat and so.
And then kam just von der do-it-yourself-bio org website of the gründer, and has said o.k, we have to uns now also bad really meet, also real meet, and has then two events organized, one in London, two thousand ten, and short then in the u.s.a, in san francisco.
Who are we, what we want, what we want, what we want, what we want, what we want, what we want?
and what are our values and what are our purpose, our foundation?
And then we have developed a code-of-conduct like that.
Das war recht intuitive, so everyone has simply so his desires, his and das, what him halt movt, ausgedrückt, then.
In my opinion, there is a very good code.
And that we have then that is not binding, but that is halt, I think already, has been relatively well passed, the people are quite convinced of so.
And then we have even tried to bring it back to the academic world, but there is it somehow not so arrived.
So I believe, we out of the biohackerszene are in the sense even a step further than the academic world.
What kind of projects do we do now?
A project that I have done with them hackteria-netzwerk in the Swiss itself, was that we wanted a so-called optische falle or optische pinzette basteln.
That is, if you focus a laser strahl, on an im room, then you can thus catch small particles in the air or in the fluidity and then in this focus move, also, that is then there catch, also as such as such a tractorbeamstrahl in the principle.
That works really, that is in the academic setting made, and we have then thought, o.k, that is rusgen we may also hin, then have a webcam genommen, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered, that is scattered.
You can see it below.
And then we have a d.v.d brenner auseinandergeschraubt and den brenner den laser rausgeholt and then tried to focus on this camera.
Unfortunately, this has not succeeded, but we have learned a lot of it.
So a different project, the out of the French group, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, the out of Paris, and the out of Paris.
and zwar hat er so a na ja, so a so a hirnwellenmessgerät, so e.e.g or so something, so er has engaged in neurobiology, his nickname is sam neurohack.
He then has this helmet, and in the cooperation with them the museum is the way.
Then the visitors in the room could come back, sit on this chair, put on this helmet.
Then their gehirnwellen were gemessen, and if we follow what they have thought or what they have thought, then they are different lichter im raum angegangen.
It was a pretty schickes project.
A different thing from the U.S. is that the p.c.r. is that the polymerase-ketten reaction is that the complexities are wort.
It is also possible to copy, multiply, and multiply fragments, so that you can make them visible.
So if I now do that that the profiles am tatort, go then hin, sammeln da any hairproben, and then do that these wenden then this method an, and then they can say, o.k, this hair belongs to this man, so.
And the machines that do so something, that are quite expensive so, that man commercially kauft, that cheapest go so at four thousand euros los.
And that’s not in the hobby area, but it’s a really cool technology that can also be very much.
So that’s just an application of many people that you can do with it.
And they have been so two two bastler ranged and said, o.k., that makes us easier and cheaper, and then have just out of open source, also free available hardware, electronics, this device has been aggregated and are now that have even brought it to the marketreife and are now the cheapest provider of these devices worldwide.
I think, somehow so sixshundert dollars or something like that.
But on one fall it is now it is still not cheap, but it is on one fall in a rahmen, where it will become clearly more available.
So it is, in my opinion, a very successful hack.
A project, which I last had angefangen, was a gene-gun to build.
Gene-gun is, yes, like such an art air-printed pistol, which shots about so far, two centimeters or so.
Man loads d.n.a. on gold particles and the gold particles then in this air pressure pistol, and then I shot them then on zwiebeln and then brought them to the light so.
That’s what you see, that’s what you see, that’s what you see, that’s what you don’t work.
but das is so my so my prototype, which but quite abgefahren appeared, so on so one ast, the ding drauf, the electronic drauf and druck connected, and the war but the druck was too high, the ding is cut gone.
And then I took a stage spender and attached it to it.
A scene spender, if man den voll macht mit wasser, has enough druck, so I glaube, so vierzig bis sechtzig bar about drauf.
And so you can then accelerate the particles strong enough and then go the particles also into the zwiebel rein.
and the commercial gerät costs approximately fifteen thousand euros upwards or something like that, scenespender so um the fifty-six.
also that it has not the same efficiency, but it is im principle halt machbar.
So and that is still in the moment also the core concern of the scene just to increase this availability of technology and also to increase the information and understanding that more people can engage in it.
Because, as I am anfang said, it is an extremely important technology, and most people have relatively little awareness of it and also no chance to really well form themselves.
Because, if you only read about it, from secondary literature, that is not the same, as if you have done it once or seen it.
And I think, technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies.
And if you as an informier citizen can also make meaningful decisions in the society will and mitreden will, then you need the access to knowledge and to technology.
And you must also do and understand it, in order to be able to do and understand it.
and the firmiert then under the schlagwords open knowledge and citizen science.
So that just man as a citizen is placed in the low, just to interact with these scientific technologies.
This is the core concern of von den biohackern.
These are the people who have at least officially registered on the website, i.y.bio-dot-org website.
This is already a relatively significant number of people worldwide.
And it is also interesting that they are also represented in Southeast Asia.
I believe that those who are there are fewer entered than they actually exist.
I also know of some who have not registered.
And that’s now just the biohacker, the individual people.
Partly also with these hack spaces, so this orten together there registered.
And that’s all in the beginning.
As I said, two thousand had it just angefangen.
and hacker spaces, also the computer hacker spaces, da der c-base in Berlin war the first, neunzehundertfünfundneunzig.
And that is now a giant network an very good, yes, infrastructure centers, which are represented everywhere in the world.
And we, of course, hope that we stop ourselves then similarly also expand and then also similarly well vernetzt, so that stop even more people can be involved.
And I would invite one once to deal with it and also bad self was to try out.
It is not so simple now, but it is also not impossible, if you have enough neugier hat and enough energy reinsteckt, then you get too far.
Thank you very much for listening.
The war &apos;s.
Yes, hello .
How do we humanly work?
This is a frage that moves me very much as a designer, but also im bereich im forschungsbereich usability and vor allen dingen im bereich user experience.
How man begegnet people in interactive media, so that they can use these interactive media and so that they create a satisfactory experience as possible.
I believe that the interactive media in uns archaische, cognitive models address, also denkmuster, which in our biological mind vor very, very long time have been programmed, and that we can re-create those just through interactive media.
And that is very surprising, because man and actually believes that this hochtechnology, which man da begnet, that it brings one and actually into the future, but in fact it is so that the future is precisely with us, with our archaic root.
What are archaic models now?
I have written four stiwords and I would like to explain them.
The archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models and the archaic cognitive models.
To these archaic models belong that we have a principle-natural ratio to virtuality.
Das klingt prinzipiell erstmal ungewöhnlich.
But I will look at it again and prove to them by trial that they also have a natural relationship with virtuality.
The second aspect is that we have since due to these archaic models durchaus in der lage are very, very bildlich to speak, although we are currently using a codified speech.
And the third Reich, which actually explains itself by itself.
We all know that the interactive media per definition are nonlinear, what the verneinung of linearity involves, and what we naturally say that we today feel the linearity as normal.
The fourth point is that history is for us a place of information dissemination.
What is it now with the virtuality, which is actually the most natural thing in the world.
I would like to prove it wrong to you.
How many turens have the houses, in which they live?
We will not be able to answer them spontaneously immediately, but the following will happen and happen just in the moment.
They go im geiste through this haus, in demn they live, and look at how many turns there are.
And that’s exactly what they’re doing.
They virtualize the reality and it is completely without a computer.
It’s fantastic, right?
And then we give us a lot of effort on the media-campus, for example, the virtual reality in our v.r.-labor darzustellen, while we can actually do it all the time already.
And this ability to virtualize the virtual reality, which has had the men in the vorindustrielle times even bitter necessary, because they had and had nothing.
They didn’t have any books.
They didn’t have any photolitography.
They didn’t have any mass media.
The only thing they had was their kopf.
And in this chapter the memory of the ab was played.
In this kopf the knowledge was recognised and with the help of these virtual images, the imagination, the knowledge was just transmitted.
And that’s why it’s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well.
It’s interesting if I can take a little trip.
Yes, that is going.
The interesting thing is that at this time the man was simultaneously media producer and medium self war.
If you think a bit more now.
What is the media today?
Then you will notice that there has been a change.
But I’m going to talk about it again.
An important tool for the transmission of information has been since jeher stories.
Shamanen, the priest, so-called wissenswächter, were extra abstained to know in stories to be preserved.
And today we are still very, very strongly hanging on stories.
dem autor des buches the storytelling animal , jonathan gottschall , zufolge verbingen we still yearly one thousand one hundred hours with the reception of stories .
That means for a child, that it is up to the reach of the great age, that the majority of time is living with the reception of stories, that it is up to the reach of the great age.
Now we think, our love for stories depends on the fact that we as a child have settled on the shell of our ancestors.
No, no, far away missed.
This goes much further back, in the cultures of the vorindustriellen times.
For me but in the range of interactive media as<unk> impressive is in itself that we per se in our biological thinking have verankerted the ability to think nonlinear.
I have given them an example mitgebracht of the North American stamm of the nootka-indian .
They lived in the coastal region of British Columbia.
And as you can see, it is a very inselreiches gebiet and you had to navigate somehow, from insel to insel to come, in order to acquire the replacement.
And they have made that with the so-called lead-landcards.
You may know that, if you are interested in it a bit, by the Australian ureinwohnern.
They have similar principles.
They have no lead-landcards, but they have the so gennanten songlines used or also traumpfade.
And what’s interesting about it is that the navigation and the topography of regions over lieder could be abgebildet.
Speech undergeordnet von untergeordnetem rang war.
That is, you navigated over the sound and over the rhythm.
And these sounds and this rhythm have represented the geology, the topography of a region, and that has, of course, also allowed that one could defragmentate these lines and otherwise aggregate and thus move back to the links, to the right, and also back to the output.
Why do we no longer sing to come from above from a to b?
At least not to navigate.
What is actually passive?
Passed is das das so gennante machinenzeitalter.
We have moved ourselves in the so-called Vogt-Zeitalter before.
passert is the machinenzeitalter and passert is the buch and passert is the photolitography.
And that’s exactly what has happened that we have transferred the responsibility for our memories and that our own production of our individual memories to external media.
On the book and on the picture.
Thus, we have unfortunately Gods a bit far learned to virtualize.
Virtuality has suddenly become a stranger to us, and has nothing to do with reality.
Bruce Brown, a well-known designforscher at the Brighton University, is so far gone to say that these mass media, er meint das buch and das bild, also not the television, the internet, etc. and so on, what we as mass media today mean, that these mass media have versteined our memories and erudited our ability to virtualize.
Let’s make a small balance.
vom vogt-zeitalter to the machinenzeitalter.
What has it influenced our minds and our memories?
Then they are the verblassing influences of the vorindustrielle cultures.
And they will be in the course of the centuries more and more overwritten by the influence of the machinenzeitalters.
That means, instead of ens individually to remember we have standardized, wide verbreitete, in massen verbreitete muster of memories, an which we can hang our personal memories.
We do not produce ourselves anymore.
We have an abstract and an abstract speech.
We put ourselves the matter no longer in imagesn the things no longer in imagesn vor, but we codify them you our speech.
We are accustomed to the fact that things happen linearly.
And we have accepted the linearity as a law and there are only exceptions, such as for example the non-linearity.
Was uns remaining is, is the story.
still are we the storytelling as information transmission very, very strongly arrested.
The question is, what is coming now?
We had the vogt-zeitalter, we had the machinenzeitalter and we describe the so-called cyber-zeitalter.
It sounds very spacig and it sounds very spacig after science fiction, I know.
But these concepts of the cyber-zeitalters that bring us these possibilities back our abilities to discover again.
It is a virtuality, it is a non-linearity, it is a storytelling.
I will explain it a little bit.
There are technical concepts such as, for example, the augmented reality, that is, the expanded reality.
So, if they’re wrong with Google glasses, for example, angucken, then there’s such a concept, which allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again, that is, our affinity to virtualization, the virtual as something normal, natural to feel, is again addressed.
Another example is the so-called virtual reality.
So verrückt das natürlich im Zusammenhang meines vortrages klingen mag, da bewegen wir uns körperlich in nicht existenten, virtuellen welten, ganz nach dem vorbild des holodecks.
And others another example are the environmental, intelligent systems.
These are spaces that can intelligently react to a human being.
All das needs the ability to accept our basic ability, virtuality as a real living space.
I have im abschluss and I hope, the video works, a very, very beautiful project mitgebracht, that is the bachelorarbeit of Michael Burk, ann-kathrin krenz, joris klause and jan-moritz muller.
And the two writers are here today.
You may be able to wake up a little bit so that you can talk in a break with the two about the project.
And this project I have as an example metgebracht, how this archaic, cognitive model is addressed again.
This is a game, I have to say about it.
was dem storytelling of course extremely entgegenkommt and it is a computer game .
And if I sage computer game, then they have very likely vor eyes that any leuten leute vor any console herumhappeln or that they play with the with any console in the hand.
In one case, that they are the drin tun.
This is a game for the outside.
And that is intended to be that I find out the outside world, so that I find out the real world again.
And this game connects the virtual world, also that dates the data space, that we produce, with the real world.
I apologize that I have to abbreviate so strongly.
You can then explain it much better, so there’s much more behind you.
And it’s because I’m entdecke a city, by showing which orten has been positive or negative getwittert.
And so I get from the city a completely different view, a completely different impression, that is, I see the negative and positive zones of a city and so I get on this art and weise a completely different, virtual landscape of a very real city.
And we can do so very well now.
Oh, what you can see here, sorry, is still a small explanation of what you can see here.
Of course this virtual world in the mauern of our cities, is and clear.
And with an art pocket lamp we can make this virtual welten visible.
So, I would like to summarize my talk and in that mind that the properties and skills that we have acquired from the vogt-zeitalter, and that we are so slightly shrinked in the machinenzeitalter, that they can be activated again with the help of the so-called cyber-zeitalters, and that we are on this art and weise over complex, technological, new products actually not in the future, but actually to us back to our root.
A lot of thanks.
I am very pleased to be with you.
I’m just asked if this sack is a sprechender sack and I’m going to speak instead of me.
That will not be done.
I’m going to dissolve what the drin is.
But so far I’m just a bit curious.
Yes, kids are from nature out of neugierig or should be neugierig, designer too.
I am a gestalter of haus out, so I am concerned of course with the theme of the neugier and how it changes the neugier again our thought, and why we lose we may also lose the neugier and must &apos;s again new anstoßen etc and so on.
This is a whole series of things, with which one, alongside them, is actually engaged as a gestalter.
If professors become curious, then they are often reingeschoben in so &apos;n forschungssemester.
And that’s what I’ve had in the last half of the year.
A forschung semester to the theme natural user interface design.
Now they’ll be wondering why the whole gestalter gets involved with so natural, archaic forms of communication, interaction, etc. and so on.
And there I keep only one of these small geräten high, because those things should always be more intuitive, more natural, more user-friendly, and there you have to stop looking at what is actually for us humans natural, what is user-friendly or intuitive.
and before them background I have me in the natural user interface design, also the next generation in the umgang mensch computer in the also in the relationship of the mensch computers is engaged in how our tools or how the computer vom rechner successively to the digital assistant change.
I’m also worried about when it’s natural or intuitive.
Per<unk> you need to take a look back again.
Why does that happen at all?
So if we look wrong at the development of our society, here shortly presented, then we move ourselves now from the third to the fourth generation of society or society form.
Also from the modern in the computer society.
Each society is characterized by a primary medium.
I am anfang the stammes society through the speech.
That is, man has found himself, by means that man has spoken a common speech, man can communicate with each other, is in the same hole gezogen or in other regions, hat städte gebildet or dörfer and hat so &apos;n stammesgesellschaft sozusagen created.
Das primärmedium war aber die Sprache, something very natural, something very lebendiges.
It was also necessary to learn, so no child can speak from nature, but we learn it successively and proportionately naturally.
It was then abolished by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction.
That was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was, that was.
If we follow as I meißel and when I meißel, it is, of course, a completely different berichterstattung, than if there is a living sozusagen of itself.
But successively, this writing was then the primary medium, erhielt enzug.
Then we come to the next generation, in which we are actually still primary today.
That’s just that through Druck and Print written with Goodberg and others.
Damals war &apos;s precisely an affront, wo adel, klerus and others have said: if you are really wahnsinnig, if the people begin to read, then they want to follow and that is, of course, total fatal.
And now we come into the next generation and the exciting is, so a generation change is only every couple of hundred years and we are in the moment really in this phenomenal phase that we are so much involved.
Das verwirrt uns naturally total because we see on one page the new media, social media, facebook, etc. and so on.
With total transparency, what the new thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the old thought is, what the
And these two well-known people just crack each other, think new and other things.
The exciting thing to this is, when man anguckt, this new society, this computer society, entlehnt himself very vieler mechanisms, principles and archaic thinking from the out of the stammes society.
But now no longer on local ebene, but on globaler ebene.
We have understood that the weather is global.
The theme of ecology is a global.
Not, if I think local ecologically here and the neighbor thinks less ecologically, then the whole does not work anymore.
This means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principle, as natural as possible, as intuitive as possible, but also the total transparency.
so as man damals im dorf knew, who had was with whom and when, so passert das heutzutage over this erweiterung of our own through these mobile end devices on globaler ebene.
We know that we know global calls and ever faster and ever better calls.
As it happened in the past in the village.
What is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us, what is for us?
Because often come namely people, they can &apos;s not make use-friendly, so that everyone can deal with it.
So you have to deal with what it means, and not only simply change it, that it is different, but it should and should also be better.
And when, of course, it is also something intuitive and how can I, as a gestalter, influence it and accordingly make the things so that they are a user-friendly, so as intuitive as possible, because then they make them spaß and are easy to use.
Then, even during the studies, the subject of perception and perception psychology is dealt with.
And that’s, of course, also was, where man then starts and looks and says, okay, now I’m just mal in the inner self in it.
And how do you see &apos;s if it really is drin out?
So how do we work when we reingucken?
What does it mean, in fact, natural, intuitive, and how do our channels of perception work and how does the cognitive processing work?
Because Steve Jobs has wrongly said, you need to say deeper to understand how it works.
So you really need to look in detail, if I want to do something ususfreundlich or intuitive handhabbar, what means that is im kern.
And then you see already that man a our seven minds, the most think we have only five, now are even seven recognized, then comes<unk> in the near future even the next, eight minds hinzu, and as erweiterung also again our own.
And to see, how do we process information, how do we take information on?
To say alone, what is information?
Information is every difference that makes a difference.
Many use the word, know but not, what it then means in detail.
But I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand, I must understand.
And of course, also, how gestation takes influence on the perception.
We see that here, if I design things, then I can make them confused like on the right side, where I don’t know, what is salz and pfeffer, or I can make them almost intuitively, by showing things.
also a lot more natural, but I see sozusagen directly, wo is salz and pfeffer drin.
And if I tell someone, give me a bad salt or pfeffer, then it will be at the right first time overwhelming, where is it was drin.
And when linken simply intuitively access and I then hope that there is no sugar drink, that salts just give accordingly.
But also our perception itself, how it deceives us as well.
For example, this perception in the context.
The right circle looks bigger than the small, although it is not the fall, but it is equally large, and yet our perception changes, depending on the context in which we reinstell things.
Anyone knows what this is?
How is it.
The pattern recognition should still work.
I think it’s going to be more than my glasses.
Also it is &apos;n creis .
A second circle begins already an, certain similarity to correlate or to associate.
And if I then stop another half-val to do so, then we suddenly see no more than one unit, namely the cross, the cross, and, but we see one unit, we see no more than three for you, the one cross, the one cross, the other.
This is called the gestalt law or gestalt psychology, which also influences us again and again in the perception.
It is important for the gestalter who have the most in the first semester, the tollen gestaltgesetze.
Gestaltgesetz der Kontinuität, Gestaltgesetz der Kontinuität and so on.
Sometimes we forget it again.
But that is an essential important component, if you want to make things as appropriate as intuitive as possible.
The next phenomenon, which was also very interesting is the des sehens.
It sounds very banal, but it’s quite exciting if you’re closer concerned with it.
So we have the front of the eyes and now they think, we see from the front to the back.
That is false.
They see firstly from hinten to advance.
For example, they project a annahme after the front that they see something, what they recognize,<unk>elweise the cross.
That means, we project only our sight, before we are then see, that again after the sight in our seheapparat reinbringen, um to say, okay,
I have so &apos;ne cognitive rückkoppelung, you have been projected, what you see wantest.
It’s there, it’s there and it’s back.
Then you go back to the front, because the hint does not trust them in the front and says, now gucke yet really again please after and sure you ab, ob das, what you see, also that is, what you want to see.
And then goes &apos;s back to the hint and then is &apos;s actually only seen.
So a whole, very exciting process, how certain things pass and in what was for a millisecond-range these things happen.
I don’t know who of them knows this picture.
That happens exactly the same as what I’ve just described.
Now everyone is trying to realize something from this pattern.
I don’t know who was recognized.
Does anyone see something specific?
It’s a Dalmatian, exactly.
If I’ve seen it once that it’s a Dalmatiner Drin, then you know it.
They will not be forgotten anymore, because I show them where the Dalmatian is.
Now see the Dalmatiner.
And now, you will always see him.
That is, I have her now actually dahingehend verdorben that she no longer recognizes a muster dadrin, but I have her conditioned within the kürzester time, repeatedly and repeatedly to see this dog in this verworrenen picture.
And that’s this projection des sehens, backup, see.
I now know I &apos;s and now projieziere I nach vorne that I den dalmatiner see.
I see the Dalmatiner.
So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.
Anyone knows what three seconds are?
Long and yes.
This is our present.
So, it’s always interesting to know as a designer.
If I know, something takes three seconds, until I assume from the present in the past, then I can also very well break over waiting times, in which I do it by always engaging someone with three seconds.
It must be processed as present.
then wandert es in the past and thus I can very elegant warte times zum beispiel am computer overbrücken, if I know this phenomenon.
Was it a thousand milliseconds?
A millisecond.
It is also a very exciting phenomenon.
This is the Zeitraum, in which you fall in love.
That means, observe, if you know that now, observe that draft, who how long you look, because I assume that there is no guarantee for, what then can happen accordingly.
And sixteen milliseconds, also a very exciting phenomenon.
This is the zeitraum of the most perceptions that we have.
That is, this first impression passed in a rasant fast speed as we perceive things.
And how we see things, what we care about, and how we assure ourselves against our environment, so that we can think about them accordingly.
Of course, the gestalter not only deals with the theme of perceptions and neuronal processing or cognitive ergonomics, but primarily of course with the theme of the human-object-relation.
So how does a man do with certain things according to him?
There are once productsprachlich the practical functions, such as formal aspects or formalesthetic aspects.
There are anzeichen-functions, where I know exactly, where I really have to griffe.
But there are also symbolic functions, why is there somebody for such a small shade, wo sowieso kaum was reinpasst, so horrible summen an money out, although it is not so practical?
Therefore, we are rather on the symbolic, on the significance level, with which we as gestalter, of course, also deal with.
back to my own theme natural user interface and them theme, was of course also dahinterliegt, is usability.
usability always means how I can<unk> a certain soul as quickly as possible, or how a user in a particular nutrition context can<unk> a soul as effectively, efficiently and satisfyingly as possible.
So said &apos;s rather the norm to that.
How can I make something as useless as possible?
can I do the direct operation or need I &apos;n handbook or need I &apos;n appropriate training for it.
And less usable or user-friendly is it.
That I just make it differently and make it more beautiful does not mean that it is better handhabbar.
It must be understood as well.
And if you then partially look at the software that we have just seen, then you will also understand why neunundneunzig percent of our present-day software is little intuitive or not on anhieb nutzbar, that i-pad in many spaces or i-phone accordingly included, although &apos;s is already substantially intuitive as classic software.
In this case, intuitive usability is not only since Apple is an elementary economic factor, not an elementary success factor, if I just want to make technological devices humanly nutzbar.
Why why?
Because in the rule we are through this new art of nutzability, also the natural user interfaces, for example, five times faster in average in our soul.
They have to imagine that if they do something of the classic software, it takes five hours, and with this new art of natural software, it takes only an hour.
This does not mean that they are likely to be allowed to go home for four hours, but their employer or someone else is already aware of how they are busy with the four hours accordingly.
But I will say that it is for us, of course, a corresponding strengthening, even certain things to<unk>.
If we then go again in the range of the software, here so the first command line interfaces, which were very abstract, where man monate needed had, to deal with these systems.
Then came the next, who now have already worked with the neural model or the mental model as the software eergonomen says, namely man would have an idea of something, the metaphor, the metaphor of a desktop, to make the computer nutzbar.
So no longer null and einsen or cryptic codes, but just a metaphor.
The whole has already been significantly user-friendly, but it goes, of course, even much better.
The next generation of graphic usage surfaces already works much more with behavior.
I also gestalte as a gestalter much more häufiger the behavior than the appearance.
This is also a paradigm change.
That I suddenly that it looks increasingly unimportant for the success, just the usability becomes an application.
And if I then continue a step further in these natural user interfaces, where I per stimme, per sprache, per touch, per gest and no more per maus and cursor that things must be managed, then I am even faster and even more immediate.
But this also leads me back to the point, when will these things become more intuitive?
If they become intuitive and then I must again strapazieren and look at my little friend here, what does that mean if just from the sight of the cognitive ergonomy, when is now something really intuitive?
And that is for us people is always something intuitive when I have to think as little as possible about it.
Also scheinbar does not like to think, but it makes itself relatively simple.
The less I think about it, the more intuitive it is.
What does that mean for the designer?
That is, if we look at that we can transfer existing handlungsmodels from one to something else, for example the metaphor, then I can make the use of it as a gestalter.
That is, I can just transfer an intuitive, human handlungsmodel to a software and thus make the software substantially user-friendly.
It is, of course, the question, what is actually so the most intuitive action scheme of us men and now I have &apos;s already betrayed.
This is the so-called osit-model.
The acronym is an acronym and stands for oriented, selected, informed, transacted.
The power of each of them is the whole time, but it is the power of the unconscious and it is almost intuitive or partially instinctive.
The model is already expressed in mutterleib and is intercultural, so it works worldwide in jung and alt, and is used by us all the time, without the majority to date knowing that this model exists.
Osit osit an itself will be approximately fifty-sifty-sifty-thousand mal of uns according to activity, so im sleep has man found that it is then less frequently strapaziert than am tag.
I can now just this mental behavior model orientate, select, inform, transact and transfer to an interaction system.
And through this art of transmission, similar to the metaphor of the desktops, but now no longer a metaphor of a physical object, but a metaphor of a pattern of action, a principle of action.
And that is on a higher gral of user-friendliness than that of the transmission of a classic metaphor, namely the des desktops.
and if I do now transfer, to the example in them I orient as an overview express, selectively as an selection, inform in the falle, it comes great on me to, I can &apos;s me im detail angucken, and yes, transagieren means, I can also somewhere hinwerfen or someone send or buy and so on,
Then I can transfer it all.
I’m trying to do something wrong with a message.
Everyone has already eaten the cake.
Overview: now interagiere me sozusagen with them object, can again rauszoomen, reinzoomen.
I ruse the whole overview, can now hierauf filter and can say, zeig me only all the things with chocolate for example.
And at once I have an interface, which is substantially intuitive and is much more natural.
Because that I can touch the things like those pieces and they come to me, is much more natural than if it can make these things accessible through hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms.
Imagination is more important than knowledge, and with this phrase I would also like to conclude, a and again the notice to give, even the designer must think differently, to come to new solutions, and in this sense I thank you very gratefully for your attention and please.
I would like to help you to a very certain aspect of neugierde.
The first, when they grow up as a child, as a baby, is that they take care of the drum was what excavations they have so, yes? and if after, if their grandparents have allowed them, more or less im to play and to touch, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more, the more.
And the curiosity cannot be learned.
Darum are all those who are here and are curious, in the tat people, who have a property that one cannot learn.
I am going to go now darum, practically this whole environmental discussion, world-undergang, vierzig jahre club-of-rome, in quality to implement.
There is a central point there.
And it hangs an phosphorus.
Give Pee a chance.
One tag gives you + gives you size order about two grams of phosphorus and one tag must absorb two grams of phosphorus.
Otherwise, you can not have teeth.
They can’t store any energy.
You can’t have a knock.
We could only be as amorphe mollusken through the worldmeere glit.
If we in der Tat do not absorb and give phosphorus.
Surprisingly, it is so that we are here and with something to deal with, which would actually be &apos;not obvious, but it is not so.
Everyone speaks about energy, but no one speaks about the phosphorus problem.
The phosphorus problem is much more critical.
We are bound by two lands ab.
We have only for two years of phosphorus and already now is brought to the environment by the phosphorus-bergbau worldwide much more uranium than is used in all atoms.
alone in the last twenty-six jahren are fifteen thousand tons of uranium on our fields in Germany are verteilt.
And we take it all up.
It makes leukemia at kindern.
And we think we would protect the environment if we are a little less harmful.
Also, for example, shütz the environment, fahr less car.
Schütz die Umwelt, Mach Less Müll.
Protect the environment, consume less energy.
This is not a protection.
That’s like if I would say, shütz your kind, shlag is just dreimal rather than five times.
That’s just a little less destruction.
If we think so von der wiege bis zur bahre, then our whole land, sooner or later, will become a friedhof.
From der Wiege to der Wiege.
And the most important thing in this is, uns den boden anzusauen, as allererstes.
In the boden is over six hundred percent of the carbohydrates stored.
In the moment we build but an and lose between elf and thirty kilograms thirty tons per hectare, or on the square meter also umzurechnen.
That is, we lose in the boden about five thousand times more than the new will be formed.
We can, of course, first and foremost address the problem.
And everything is either packaging or content.
in offenbach zum beispiel sind am hausmüll zwanzig prozent des der müllmenge inzwischen windeln .
And because we get older, the windels will become greater.
They are all in the vorwindelphase.
So yes?
A baby needs about six thousand windeln.
Of course, we could reduce it by about 10 percent, but what does it power?
This will be balanced in China in a second.
This is completely irrelevant.
The question is so, how do we go with this windeln um?
This is a proof that men are not Swine.
I will tell you.
Because the phosphorus is extracted exkremely by the swine over the festen.
in the man over the urine.
Yes yes.
Therefore, men can not be swine.
That’s because it’s documented, isn’t it?
Traditionally we think we in the environmental discussion, we are too many in the world.
And if you are the people who, if you are the people who are abstract to exist, if you are saying that would be better, you would not be there, then they will become raffierig and hostile.
And so someone says like Al Gore, one of our great heroes, there is nothing more important than to stabilize the human population.
In Israel man says, if you rescue a human life, you rescue the herd.
Here it is said, the more you umbring, the better.
Yes yes.
The first question is, are we really too many?
If you look at the amys, the weight of the amys on the ground, then the amys weigh about four times more than we humans.
I could also thermiten hernehmen, but in the U.S. no one could thermiten, in so far seen, although they are vegetarian.
This means that the Americans weigh much more than us.
And because they work physically much harder than us and because they live only three to six months, they correspond in their weight, in energy consumption some thirty billion people.
That means we’re not too many, we’re too foolish, right?
and where they see how far we are away from it, what we really want to<unk> and could, and how sad we are that we are at all on the ground, they can see that for example offenbach a program has, until zwanzig vierzig wants man here to be climate neutral, right?
They can only be climate neutral if they do not exist, right?
The only chance.
Have you ever seen a climate-neutral baum?
So yes?
A single one?
That means, our entire intelligence means that we want to be dummers as bees, right?
So yes?
No baum is carbon neutral.
Unfortunately, not to luck, right?
There is no overpopulation problem an bäumen.
There is only in the amazonasgebiet still six hundred billion beams.
Have you heard some of this about the overpopulation problems of Baumen?
That means, all our intelligence means that we want to be dummers as bees.
And where they see, even with something like demeter, the strictest bio- and agriculture, does not allow our own metabolic products to go back.
Every year we lose so three million tons of phosphorus, which really must go back in the circle.
And so we are too many.
Alone about it.
That means we feel so guilty on the land that we say there is no bio-landbau, no bioland, no nature-et-progrès and as they all call, which allow our own exkremente to go back.
Is it not sad?
That is why we are too many.
It is<unk> meaningful to be less harmful, what beer consumption in terms of.
But where are we useful?
We’re trying to minimize our ecological fußabdruck, but it’s hard to have a big fußabdruck that’s useful.
We want to be good for society, we want to be good for the economy, but if it is about the environment, it is the highest, not to be there, right?
Null emission, is it?
They can only have zero emissions if they are not there.
Even if they were shooting themselves now, they would have emissions.
So you can’t solve it.
We can be different.
We can get our nutrients back.
We do in Brazilian agriculture in der von wo we the nutrients return.
We can directly recover to this art and wise nutrients in agriculture.
We do that in China for example, where we directly take the abnormalities of it.
in china is a noctopf today still honigtöpfchen, sozusagen, right?
And in our western world we have always been too stupid to bring our nutrients back.
That is, the whole western civilization history is characterized by the fact that the city has always only genommen, but the bauern has not given anything back.
Through this, the cities must grow more and more, because the bauerns go into the cities and the cities must go more and more away from their nutrients.
All the western reiche are always expanded until they have failed to<unk> the infrastructure and then they are imploded.
So yes?
In China war is different.
Man has a bruchlos civilization over five thousand years ago, because man always in the low war, that nutrients return.
Even today, if they are to eat, they are invited to eat in China, they will wait for them to eat, that they will remain sunny until they open the toilet.
Because it is unfreundlich to go and the nutrients mitzunehmen.
Man has her to man has her to the essen, not to the nutrientdiebstahl.
That means, you can see in the internet how you can get the nutrients back.
If you do that, then agriculture power, biogas erzeugt, on a hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in favelas, you can thus a bauer about one thousand and a hundred dollars inhabitants and the plant thus wait, hühner and swine züchten and either and gemmes and fish.
And the great thing is that the verbrechensrate in the favelas is about nine hundred percent back.
We also don’t have to control the people to be as little bad as possible.
We can help you to be good.
That’s, of course, high-tech agriculture, but the facilities carry themselves.
The next product is sauberes wasser.
And they are so designed, through the design, that a bauer they can simply bear.
This means that the verbrechensraten will go back.
And no of these facilities, we have now over hundred and fifty built in the last twenty-six years, no of these facilities has ever been sabotaged.
They could so easily simply reinwerfen a liter of altöl and then the anlage over jahre would be ruined.
It does not happen.
That is, we don’t have to control those people, to be as little bad as possible.
We can help you to be good.
This means that we need to recover phosphorus.
and by the way, if she was tun want daraus, write it up, in Germany the best suitable for all cläranlagen is the one in Frankfurt.
Unfortunately they don’t in offenbach, but maybe they can den frankfurtern and a little bit help in doing so.
Because the frankfurter plant could best den phosphorus return.
And he has to go back.
We see that phosphorus is really critical.
And we see that it’s hardly successful.
We have been in the Netherlands for over three years now.
The Dutch government has explained, they will be the first country in the world to be, which phosphorus returns.
But we need the whole.
There are two countries that control fast siebzig per cent of the phosphorvorkommen worldwide.
There is the OPEC a haufen of waisenknaben.
They are six hundred and twenty countries, which control four hundred percent of the ölvorräte.
And the oil we will be able to replace with other energy agents.
But the phosphorus cannot be replaced.
Darum goes not darum to do the existence a little less bad, but it goes darum to do something right.
First of all, it’s important to ask what’s right.
This means that it is about efficiency, not about efficiency.
In the Netherlands, the land is built on flowers, because in the Netherlands, the land is built on flowers.
So yes?
They show themselves when for example their wife is sad, when they are sad, when they are harsh, and they come with fifty roses.
It is completely inefficient.
But it’s quite effective, right?
Or take a lippenstift.
A woman in Germany is about six coming three kilograms during her lives.
Within it.
That is scientifically not exactly correct, because we don’t know how much will go away.
But a lippenstift, even with this enlightenment, I can tell you, is completely inefficient, but completely effective, right?
Everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient.
This is not resource efficiency, but efficiency.
Question: What is the right thing?
Not to burn the clärschamm even a little better and thus abzulagern it and in the combustion facility to lose all the materials for the circle, but to first question, how do you close the circle?
Make yourself Mozart efficient vor.
So yes?
If I give them to the abendessen enlade and sage, yes, there is a tablet with offenbach-schmack and a glass of wasser to it.
Wunderbar , &apos; no ?
This is efficient.
Everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient.
If you’re in love with someone, efficient?
So yes?
That means, everything that im life counts, is going &apos;s not darum to save, to avoid, to reduce.
The entire environmental discussion.
We say the people, oh yeah, you have and no environmental awareness in the south.
No, that wegwerfen is exactly the right thing, right?
An every star, wo man wegwirft, von, ja, schafft man again life opportunities.
But those false things.
If you remove the false things, you have a mistake problem.
This is what we think of the north.
There is every fußabdruck unpleasant.
When they run, yes, destroy every fußabdruck the boden.
Because just the boden will die moose die ab and der der wind and das wasser wäscht den boden weg.
But if they are in Italian, every fußabdruck means that the wasser remains in the wiese for longer.
So, it’s going on to create a big fußabdruck that will become a feuchter.
Not debt management.
We say in Germany sustainability.
So yes?
But if I ask her, how is it with her wife?
What do you say then?
Sustainable .
So I say, herzliches beileid, right?
That’s just the minimum.
So don’t save, give up, avoid.
Every waste is a nutrient.
And it’s a pleasure when they see in Italian, like the leute im hohen bogen so &apos;ne coladose from the auto rausschmeißen, to that.
For you know, that’s a lustvoller predang.
It is &apos;ne form of revierverhalten, right?
You can show me, I was there.
But with the right design, please nice.
We have for example developed an eiscreme packaging, which is at room temperature &apos;ne flussigkeit.
They can throw them away, where they go and stand.
In two hours, she baptists everywhere.
And it contains together von seltenen pflanzen, so that it through the wegwerfen zur artenvielfalt beitragen.
This means that we are useful, not less harmful.
There are also two crossroads.
Not everything should be compoundable.
A fernseher or a washing machine, which uses it and only, which uses it not.
Only the things that slide, such as schuhsolen, such as brakes, such as autoreifen, that must be so that they go into biological systems.
The things that are only used go into technical systems.
But today we are talking only about the biological systems.
So yes?
To be the example of the sneaker, right?
Very direct advertising, and not for the company puma per se, but for the fact that they now help this company to make these products successful.
Because we don’t make the things free of us anymore.
So yes?
So, if I invite them to eat and to be wise, that is free of wrath, then help them that is nothing.
No, we legate a party, what drin is.
The positive.
It’s not like detox.
No toxic drin.
But everything that is drin is useful.
These are the first shoes with which you can climb the kavalierstart an der fußgängerampel and the rubber in biological circle can go, right?
All of this is compoundable from it.
And if it’s a good thing, it’s a good thing for adidas, for nike, for her and mauritz and the whole textile industry.
This is the half of all waste problems worldwide that are caused by the textile industry.
Don’t help you, don’t help you, don’t help you, don’t help you, don’t help you, don’t help you.
Hey Puma, can you really be serious?
Because they have already twice changed the chairman.
And I’m not so sure if they’re really dabeibleiben.
Also, help me a little bit.
But it goes.
Yes yes.
That, what is just being presented.
That goes.
We can do the things now so that they, when they go down, when they go down, can make them in biological circles.
Technical crossroads give &apos;s genauso .
There is a direct rücknamesystem.
Das is the first ecological rucksack, in fact, which is made for it, in the circle to go back.
Also, in every store, you can recover the things.
If you’re coming to that, right?
Do you remember the winds still bad?
If in the moment is the mould.
Everywhere are these windeln rums, nahezu.
In the countryside, where the people come to money.
Da vorn op den deponien, but also otherwise in the landscape, right?
If we change the plastic so that it is in biological systems can go, if we change the wasserspeicher, drinnen, that they can just return to the cellulosebase, then they can plant with a baby in Israel or in Tunisia hundred and fifty-five beams.
So yes?
Only if they take this windel, they zerkleinern, sterilize and take the powder, so that the beam will pflanze.
This means that the baby is carbon-positive for the whole life, already from the beginning.
So we don’t need to be climate-neutral, we can be climate-positive.
It’s going to be a beneficial poop print.
Yes, it is so-called.
So yes?
We can do that.
We can inherit everything.
I have established a institute for this.
Inzwischen there work a lot of people with me and they can all engage.
There is an extra one verein to this, cradle-to-cradle-verein, where everyone can participate.
Also no longer save, abandon, avoid, reduce, no debt management, but intelligent waste.
Does it make you curious?
Thank you very nice.
The work of the interpreter.
Music as a speech.
In the description to my network it is written that I as an interpreter, me as a translator, also in English wortsinn, understand.
interprets are translators of the written notes in clingende music.
That man as a translator does not overtake the word for the word the text in another language, but also the deeper mind of the word and the context of the word must be understood, so that it produces a meaningful translation, everyone who has to do it with foreign languages knows.
already out of the German ins English to translate, can more know erfordern, zumal is if man if it is then um dichtung or gar um poesie goes.
Very strange is it but for wide, was we musicians with our music language tun.
As an interpreter of a musical piece, I first have only the written notes.
They think they are sure that the composer in the notes has exactly everything in writing, what is therefore erdacht has.
In reality, the notes are very vage and unclear.
These notes are approximately exact or unclear, as a verbal, although very apparent penibelst genaue, a description of a landscape.
For in this verbal landscape description, the flavour of the flowers is not to smell, the degree of the green only to erahnen, the säuseln des winds not to hear, not to feel.
That means that the interpreter must translate these ungenauen angaben der notensprache into another, i.e. hearing, concrete, nonverbal music language.
Today I want to translate them, what I otherwise musicalisch translate, also interpret, again in a verbal language.
Practically also a translation of the translation.
That’s why I ziehe es vor, das ganze lieber auf deutsch zu tun, for if I also translate it again in English, it would be equal to me with the translation of the translation.
The music also works so similar to the spoken speech for me.
The notified notes have the function of the letter of a letter.
It is also not enough, just not to learn to read and to press the corresponding keyboards on the piano or the right star on a violinsite.
That would be just the bookstaben, which man has learned, too male.
The mind of the buchstaben is recognized only when it is possible to speak it.
Consequently, it is necessary for the learning process of the music music language at least as long as for the gesprochene language.
There is also abstufungen, if man is for the hausgebrauch lernt, only passive understand or man can also actively speak, until the musical muttersprachler.
The work of the interpreter is similar to the work of a theater director.
After you first play a piece of selected hat, because you are enthusiastic about it, you first search for the background of the formation of the composition.
Man gathers information about the piece in the secondary literature.
man liest in den briefen, tagebüchern, notizen, or ob es worte, gedanken vom komponisten selbst gibt.
Man studies the work, which is before and after composite has.
He puts a vergle.
The reason for it is to write.
How and what has been perceived?
What were his life conditions, such as those of society and politics?
Everything interests me.
Man thinks in this time, by example, contemporary images anschaut or literature read.
With the time man has but also as an interpreter already a reiches know about the composer, the man more often plays, and it falls to one increasingly easier to think and feel in him.
The composer becomes more and more to the friend, with whom man lives together.
His concern, that piece to write, is becoming more and more to my personal concern, it is to play.
Da nun die noten everything other than a precise recording of the concerns of the composite, but only a gerüst, wende i nun this gerüst an, um es again to fill with mind and meaning.
I then say with my own words, what could be written between this truthful.
I play to explain what these thresholds might mean.
Now for me and for the composer damals and what they now could mean for him today.
Every tone, every phrase gets thus a mind, because I am self-empfinde, because it is from my now personally living entspringt.
It must be stimmig for me here and now, otherwise I can’t convince my audience that this is my concern.
It’s always a very happy concert, if I can have the experience, the piece, that I so long im voraus erarbeitet hab, how new to experience.
As a happy new tag is always again and again new, although always with the same rituals of life, up, breakfast, to work go, so erlebe also I the same piece again and again new.
I am again a tag older, the jahreszeiten change, my pulse goes abends slower than am tomorrow, in a concert hall it takes longer, that the schall returns back than too home.
I don’t think the audience is true, conscious or unconscious.
All that affects me and all that affects my experience with the composition.
Very wonderful is also when I am with a duo-partner on the stage stehe and we have the same wellenlänge.
Then happens the same as in a good, angeregten conversation.
You bring a new idea into it and suddenly you will be answered with a reaction.
It’s exciting, because then things happen that we haven’t tried so much and what you can’t try so much.
It makes great space to make this wise music, and they as the audience have then experienced how the music lively communicates.
Each concert is a different concert.
I’m never going to play again like this moment.
I can't play like in zwanzig jahren today.
I will have more life experience than today, and therefore I will have much more color, emotions and sensations on my music palette than today.
I’m sure I’ll have a few colors, but I’m sure I’ll have a few colors, but I’m sure I’ll have a few colors.
I have a clear concrete example of this.
It was on a piano course for a music student with my beloved old teacher, professor Jürgen Uda, a bekannter Beethoven-specialist, concertpianist and long-year professor of the musichochschule here in Stuttgart.
Unfortunately I was still a lot too jung, so soass is already emeritiert war, as I finally anfing to study.
But I had the great luck, he was very early, with dreizehn jahren, kennenzulernen and so I was already at my scholzeit on his course.
I was damals siebzehn, when I participated again on one of his courses and played the last of the four balladen of chopin, a spätwerk.
I wonder what the initiative of this ballade is for me.
This is such a getragenes part.
And in my youth I said, expectation.
I thought it was and thought it, right?
That must be the difference.
For me, it means a memory.
It was over sixty.
Yes, with sebzehn you have still dreams, but no meaningful memories.
I play today the piece every couple of years again and always has it wandered for me, although no one note has changed.
Every time it’s exciting, because I always read something new out.
Monet has the seerosen x-mal gemalt.
It is always the same gardens, but too different times, with different lights.
er hat die seerosen translated differently, as it has been seen, as it has acted on him at this moment.
His personal impressionen der seerosen.
The x-malige interpretation of a piece is comparable to this.
Inzwischen bin ich zudem is already older than chopin with twenty-thirty jahren, as er das stück wrote.
Er hat and only nine hundred and thirty jahre gelebt.
And it’s important for me to look at the notes again and again, even if I mean, to be able to get them out.
um zwiesprache to keep, directly with them composite.
Because the notes are the only connection directly to him.
Especially when you’re already pregnant.
So, how do you get to speak the language of music?
I said yes, you need about as long as for the spoken speech.
Often it is the music lesson and so that you only learn the notes to read.
Man does not learn practically the first to read before he speaks just one word.
Man lernt, that töne zu den noten auf dem instrument to find.
If then all the finger in time and correctly as it is in the note stands moving, then come the thin out, which together so sound like music.
If the error-free happens, the student gets the next difficult piece up.
About interpretation is hardly spoken in the beginner lesson.
Well, then stand ahead soon, that’s a quick piece.
Slow and slow.
sea and leisezeichen, f and b, and cetera.
Most people know it here.
But even if these data are implemented, it remains somewhat technical.
There is always no interpretation.
I am surprised.
I am surprised that you often forget something very elementary.
In other words, in order to make music on that instrument, your own musical tun and feel should be present before.
That is the singing.
A kind, which does not learn to sing, because the elders do not have prepared, will not be tuned by themselves.
It’s like speaking.
It is necessary to have his own experiences and the idea of music, to then bring it over another possibility, also over an instrument, to the sound.
Men, who have not singed, have consequently not directly felt with their own body, how it is, to form a tone.
Create a phrase with your own atem.
The musical instrument is the erweiterung of our body.
Our stimbands to sing, our hands and our mouths to dance.
So are the hammerköpfe im piano the continuation of my finger.
The melody arises from the song and the rhythm from the dance.
Die dauernde berieselung heutzutage mit music is da not förderlich .
You don’t need to make music yourself anymore when it becomes boring.
It is no longer necessary, a liedchen to pfeifen or to sing.
Every own music is platted, when man dauernd von außen is scalled with music.
Certainly, there are then many among them, who say, yes, but what is power man, if I just can’t sing?
They can’t sing, because they believe they can’t sing.
Or because you haven’t learned to sing?
In both, it is not too late to start, to find out if they can’t, or to learn how to correctly use these small muscles that set the stimbands.
This can be done to train.
Or c, because you are confident to them that they are unnecessary.
I wonder how expert was this diagnosis?
Have you already had a two- or drittmeinung geholt, how is it right now nice to say?
Or, they don’t want to stop music and therefore they want to have nothing to do with it.
I was then but already bedauern would, because music is and a beautiful, communicative thing.
But maybe you can even apply it.
Yes, so you see, in any case, no one must be a possible-sloser candidate.
I don’t understand anything, I don’t understand anything about classical music.
I can’t say whether it’s good or bad.
I’m sure you can answer, but you can say if you like it or not.
I don't think, I don't think, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
So, they give up and don’t eat, just because they can’t cook.
They also do not have to give up classical music, because they do not play any instrument.
Listen to them consciously and tell them whether they taste it or not.
Whether the music is too pepper or too sweet.
Tell them what they feel.
With the time they also get responses and want a little more würze because drinhaben or taste even feine differences out.
Why do I now advocate from my audience that it is also active?
Because music is a language and a language is to communicate there.
A work of art, which man does not listen, has no power to work.
The essen, which was cooked lovingly by a kitchen or a kitchen, must be eaten and not only angschaut or recipes exchanged.
Also, please listen when a music is played.
She’s not just a nice gentleman.
If in an environment, where the adults make active music or at least listen to active music, a child grows up, then it’s quite easy for a music teacher to ask, what color has your flower?
Can you also play in blue?
And the kind plays, after a memorial break, instead of before a rote now a blue flower.
And this sounds completely different than before.
That was then the allererste beginning of a own musical ausdrucks.
This is also the first step towards an interpretation.
And what happens if you play a piece today, which is originally written in vor hundert, vor zweihundert or gar vor dreihundert jahren?
In the meantime, the tools have evolved.
There was to the time Bachs as an instrument and not a piano.
It was simply not invented yet.
I think that the bach would have been enthusiastic if it had had gehabt the sound possibilities of today’s modern keyboard.
I can bring today the clangrepresentations, which the bach gehabt has, on the modern flügel to the clingen, which a barock cembalo cannot.
Also von Beethoven knows man that there is more hearing than he has already become taub war.
Today is a modern orchestra in der lage, everything to play, was an orchestra of damals as unspielbar abgelehnt hat.
Therefore, the composers are dependent on our interpreters, who will re-innovate the piece.
so that they may be heard, what they have thought only in the spirit.
And what they would think today in the spirit.
Or what I imagine today, because what you might have thought about.
Thank you very nice.
Do you know what they are?
Have you ever been a female?
How did you feel that an?
It is beschissen.
I have a friend who fährs a pass.
When I then come, with my little v w piesel and me daneben stelle, this feeling comes up.
I shoot something through the head.
I know, ulf, what do you need so &apos;n large cars?
In the first half of the year, the first half of the war was lost.
And at all, you work and much less than me.
Why do I have to allow me so &apos;n small cars?
And then I immediately think that’s unfair.
It is against justice.
And as I do the wort of justice sage, this unpleasant feeling is gone.
Our body has invented a great method to bring such unpleasant feelings like them simply to disappear.
They can also try it with words like rache or winnsucht or similar.
I would like to explain something to them today with this mechanism, or to bring something nearby, which unconsciously is likely to be familiar to them.
The mechanism comes from the lie.
But do not think about the lies, as you may have heard them, when people say, no one has the intention to build a mauer.
And then the stones are upward, so that the sight is closed to them.
In one such lie they see that the liar himself does not believe what he says.
It can be overdies easily verified that it is quite different in the mind has.
He is deceitful and only he and not himself.
No, the liar, over which I speak, the liar has to do with the fact that they themselves deceive.
They need this lies to be a lies to be a lies to be a self-deception.
They can get them less easily, yes, check out, or even bring them to the intrusion.
They need time.
From this time speaks an anecdote that you may know.
Derische spanische maler pablo picasso has once a woman portraitiert .
This woman has then complained that the portrait would not look like her at all.
Picasso answered, wait you only.
They are becoming more and more similar to them.
In this star and when they laugh, they realize how important this lies is and how much time they need to learn something, what artists can tell very well.
Artists have a gestorts ratio to lies.
The artist shares them something with, and especially this lady, what she doesn’t see, if she just looks in the mirror.
The artists share with them in a soothing portrait something with which they will only get acquainted when they look at this work again and again.
Then this unpleasant feeling disappears, it could not look like them, and it becomes more and more like them.
Here you have this mechanism, with which we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our living relationships.
And not only in the art, but also in the volksmark, in the mythology, in the stories, it opens again.
You may know this idea of the lady, who one morning shines in the mirror and fragts him, who is the most beautiful in the whole country?
One tages says that mirror, yes, there is one more beautiful.
Behind the seven mountains and so on.
And they also know how much hostility comes from this true output, even the mirror cannot lie, from this true output comes.
But we should simply make us familiar so that a man cannot say to a woman that there is a more beautiful elsewhere.
Here it is necessary, that, what we under politically correctness understand, is always and again to be inserted.
We need this star of lies, which keeps us deceived, without which we cannot survive.
We have not only such great lies in the art, in the volksmärchendichtung, but also in science.
This is the story of the Woman of the Bishops of Worchester.
She heard of this book by Charles Darwin, the emergence of the species and the abstammung of men.
That der mensch vom affen abstammen should and, yes, it is at least a common prejudice between mankind and affen.
And then she ran and threw her to her husband and said, “This is<unk> not true, what Charles says.”
Der mensch must vom affen abstammen or have a common predecessor.
No, no, no, that’s not possible.
And if it is true, then we must prevent the people from getting knowledge of it.
Why should we prevent that human knowledge of something erlangen when it is true?
Because we can’t live without this life.
Because we are this self-deception, this feeling, to be great, abstamming from the highest being, not from a solche natural, from something as unpreciable as an organism that still exists, a stone comparable and otherwise what things, that is for us unbualable.
We can’t tolerate these things at all.
We must prevent the people from getting knowledge of things, especially when they are true.
So that they see how slowly this mechanism dissolves, and how the traces that they leave, which lead to something other than this great picture of ourselves, look like, I will bring them another story.
This is a very good story, as I mean.
My wife has told me.
She came to a tages of the school, she is a teacher, and she talked about a student.
He is an autistic student.
She loves him especially because he has a tendency to sincerity.
What is your hobby, what is your hobby?
And then he said, yes, I am at the firewehr.
And because I am at the feuerwehr, I am interested in pyrotechnical things.
Yes, she feels it already, if she’s heiter are an this star. there’s something wrong.
I have said to my wife, every time a man in a moral justification the wörtchen because it is used, we should try to replace it by the wörtchen though.
Do it once and then learn the satz.
Although I am at the firewehr bin, I am interested in pyrotechnical things.
They feel, that’s the true truth behind the outsourcing.
So a small bub that is not interested in fors feuerlöschen.
He is interested in the feuermachen.
But there is no truth, according to which we can see one another, where man learns, how man feuer macht.
There is only the two best, the firewehr.
He has been registered.
And overdies, you say also to your teacher not, that you like to burn somewhere legt and rejoice when the fire afterwards highloated.
No, it just looks much better when we show that we are responsible for eliminating the dangers that others can do only when they just light the fire.
Here you have this small mechanism.
This indicates that in the innerst of the bub he already knew that he is actually related to the fire, but that he can’t say that he is not sound.
Here you have this sensor between the unconscious and the conscious, which immediately anspringt, without being able to do anything, and the things from which you know that you look completely different, so designed that you can sound much better for you and others.
Thus there are simply such words that we use repeatedly and repeatedly in the speech of political correct speech.
In fact, we know that something else falls.
But we know, when we say that, the social relationships are very sensitively distorted.
We can’t do that easily.
It is impossible to present such things in a society that is to function.
I’d like to tell you what we’ve discovered in my institution.
after which logic this deception, this self-deception, that alreadychaft, another reality than that, from which we actually already know unconsciously that it is valid, to spread to the outside.
I will present you two, maybe three<unk>.
The first beispiel sets out what many of them know and many of them value, very few just don’t need at all.
I mean the soul.
What is the soul?
Die Seele is so a little geistiges, says like leibniz.
It is something, which is not by stop material, material nature is.
And if they have men before themselves, who are the faithful of the feast, that they possess a soul, or one can also say, that they believe that they have been raised by the soul to life, then they make themselves so approximately, as if the soul was such a spiritual mercy over them, not from matter, they themselves only from flesh and blood, something steinernes sozusagen, an erde binding, vergängliche, verwesbares, unimportant, and all.
And from this soul they think now that they are somehow in this wolkigen nature, in this luftigen nature, anima means it is im latinische, der lufthauch, present sei.
And if this airbag then rises over the man, then it is filled with me, with spirit, with nature, which can only live, and with the soul.
And then they can run away.
This is how the soul works.
It should also come from the outside to the man.
We must also perceive them as something that must be present for our lives.
And if they have this prerequisite before sight, then they understand the logic with which we experience this happiness, to be able to improve our world through a lie.
Now you can use a dreisatz.
Dreisatz knows you even from the school.
This is now here a dreisatz that describes us a logic.
This is, of course, the hardest part in my proposal.
Here you need some logic, but also the willingness to lie.
It is so much to lie that you can simply use this logic false.
In this dreisatz there are three sentences vor.
The first satz lautet, Klaus behavior, there is no seele.
Der zweite satz lautet also, if klaus right hat, then hat er no seele.
Now there is a third satz.
I have highlighted him especially here.
It is a third phrase that immediately appears in people who have a strong feeling for a soul.
They say, whoever has no soul, he is all and cannot behave nothing.
And here they feel &apos;s already.
Here comes this logic in this, yes, in this empty network to the expression.
You see it immediately.
The first two sentences, which are logically correct.
I can behave everything.
The logic does not make any explanation over the reality.
I can say that the chancellor is a man.
And if I am right, then the Chancellor is a man.
If I’m not right, then the Chancellors are not a man.
The logic does not make an aussage about what is true.
I can behave everything.
But it’s crucial, if I’m right, then it’s right.
So when Klaus says, there is no soul.
Two, if it is right hat, then hat is no soul.
These things are logically correct.
And now feel our empty consciousness immediately, from that one can do something.
It hangs on a third Satz an, which has nothing to do with the first two Satzes, and it does so, as if the opposite of the first Satzes had already been proven and predicted.
In fact, we must prove whether the soul exists or not.
But with this logic, it is simply nutzt that two sentences are logically correct, and a dritten dazuhängt, which looks like it had something to do with, so that we can save our lives.
So, we do so, as if it was actually impossible, without a soul to be able to live.
And we are very happy about it.
We can strengthen these things in different ways.
In the present on about we have a very modern example, which repeatedly fills the tages newspaper.
Hierzu they have to keep themselves present with another philosophical theme, a dauerbrenner out of philosophy.
That has to do so that we go back in the fourteenth century.
Da gab es un gelehrten, der hieß johannes buridanus and nach dem ist der buridansche esel benannt.
The buridansche esel is an esel that consists of aus reiner nature.
He doesn’t have this soul.
This is such a naturding.
And if they place it exactly in the not between two equal heuhafen, then they are hungry.
He doesn’t know to which heuhaufen he should go first.
It is also not exactly in that.
This is how the natural dinge is presented.
Equal strengths with gegensätzlichem vorzeigenzeichen lösen one another on.
Nothing happens at all.
Only if they then bring another example, so if they immediately give a heuhaufen greater power, then they also do not need a vernunft and nothing to do so.
It automatically runs to the right thought.
If they have this idea that man also in the nature will be somehow driven, determined, by the greater haufen, which an instantly attracts one, then they also quickly have the feeling that there is something like a free will must be.
And if we are already here in Frankfurt am Main, then I remind an max-planck-institut for hirnforschung.
There is a wolf singer, which is called wolf singer, and from him says man sometimes, wolf singer behaves, there is no freedom of will.
Now we can again the second sentence and can say, if wolf singer right has, then has is no will freedom.
These sentences are absolutely logical and correct.
And what we now fast daily in the tageszeitung can read, that you can find in this third sentence.
Whoever does not have freedom of will may not be charged for his actions and behaviors, and he is therefore unreliable.
You have it again here too.
In fact, one must first prove that there is something like freedom of will.
But the logic of deception allows is uns, so to tun, as if the first phrase of vornherein was false, as if man must, of course, accept the gegenteil without evidence.
And now they can simply, if they want to do something for themselves, if they want to test something for themselves, and above all, if they want to make people happy, practice this mut to lie.
If they meet a man, to whom they can then say, there is no predecessor.
And please do not use the German word for the predecessor, that is, the prophet.
You should not say that, it would be a bit politically incorrect again.
They say there is no predecessor.
Immediately they will become one, for whom there is, of course, such predictors, know, that you can’t prove.
And you already have a problem.
For while they are busy doing so, to clarify that they cannot prove that there is no predecessor, the man is very happy.
She’s very happy about it because she’s getäuscht hat.
Because he has led her on a flight, where he himself does not stand.
In fact, this person is not interested in any evidence.
er is only interested in self freizuhalten before the need to prove that there is a predator there.
Thus, in the art of the move of the beweislast, they experience the greatness of lies.
And if they once again have such a possibility to feel this dreisatz among other people, they will do it, because they will make others happy, if they do not remind them of their self-righteousness in this way.
I thank you for your attention.
A good tag.
I have permitted I have asked Lilly if I can mention her.
She is one of the organizers here of this great event and asked me if I would like to hold a presentation here and reveal my idea.
I must honestly say, you have it and mitgekriegt, it is faithful to me anfangs hard from my idea to speak.
And maybe I can imagine my insel project that I try to present you.
But that’s, of course, the sum of all, quite a lot of ideas.
I belong probably, are the two net girls yet there, I belong probably to the generation, which for this bad eco image gesorgt hat, because I neunzehundertneunundsiebzig already angefangen habe maschinenbau to study in karlsruhe, technical high school, today it is called she, glaube me, kit.
And I had &apos;s then not the eightziger jahre to Berlin, because I wanted to make renewable energy and das gab &apos;s in karlsruhe not.
da gab &apos;s the kernelforschungsanlage leopoldshafen .
Die hießen damals all kfa, also die jülich hieß kfa.
Today it is a project tracker.
Because a good engineer has either great cars built or nuclear power plants.
But sowas doofes like &apos;n solarpendel, out of them somehow hundred watt out of the quadratmeter outcommt, das war ein spielzeug.
And in Berlin there was a mad engineer collective.
I bin dem premium-kola-mensch thankful that er das wort nochmal again rehabilitated has, because after dem mauerfall durfte man das wort gar no longer use, because everything linked war and bad.
However, the war was in the achtiziger jahren not so.
It was so that it was self-verwaltete alternative betriebe gab and one of them saß just in kreuzberg im mehringhof, wo man das böse vermutete.
ort des terrorismusses, but das war hieß wuseltronik und hat wind- and sonnenenergie made and then I have not the achtziger angefangen.
And yes, many of them, what was said today, touched me very much, because many, many beautiful expressions were there, which I have also experienced.
I have elf jahre in them collective work, the war is basic-democratic.
We were zwanzig leute.
If one said no, war das vetoprinzip, das has a completely zermürbt. i have ten years long I have hard to doubt that, if I my tolles engineering study may really an schwachsinnige matter disappear, because even all the colleagues of my vaters have always zugeredet him, you have the money to the window outsourced at your kind.
He is engaged in schwachsinn.
and das war really very, very bitter and man comes then also in so &apos; ne phase hinein, just tauchte das a picture on persistence, where I asked me had after ten jahren, a thousand d-mark were das and damals yet, grundlohn, unheitslohn im collective of course, ob das really so das tolle sein soll.
And I have been &apos;s then up to sixundneunzig held and then we together with friends bin I have become co-founder of the company solon, who then together with the spin-off q-cells became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world.
A riesenerfolgsgistory, but also there we have, of course, again the problem of a growing enterprise and we have then two thousand, a small group, decided that we will start again small and go back and us the next topic of the future widmen and that is meines erachtens and our erachtens, it is again the same mad, that starts again with that the people say, what should the quatsch, that goes not all, we speak of speichern.
And then I’ve brought you a project that I’m not going to imagine you now.
And the title of the vortrages war, and how man to hundred percent renewable comes.
And we just have to start with a relatively simple, foolish story to ask, where can one make a memorable sense already today.
On this insel, this is the insel graciosa on the azoren.
That’s what the dates are.
There are about a thousand and a half people living there.
Today they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent.
And the question is, why don’t you have it anymore?
This is simply not technologically possible.
If they get more wind power to get together, the system starts to fail.
I always tell you the politician when you visit our anlage in Berlin-adlershof.
They always say, why?
We have twenty-six percent in Germany.
It may not be a problem.
We have in Europe seven percent and our net is physically seen as the European.
If we had twenty percent in Europe, then we would have the same problems that the people on this island already have.
Die frage war simple, rechnet das war zweitausend2006 , have the first contacts with der insel angefangen, rechne doch simply mal durch.
How large should it actually be such a battery, so that you can bring such an insel on zwanzig, thirty, fourzig, fifty, maybe even seventy-six percent renewable.
I’m going to go a slide again.
The conventional system is seen everywhere in the world so out.
Over the course of the year, about a hundred gigawatt of electric power on a diesel-based base will be built on the world.
This corresponds to the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants, because this goes<unk> fast everywhere.
The energy hunger of the world, which takes place, is destroyed with diesel, because there is no need for approval.
It goes fast.
Man puts so &apos; not kiste hin .
And then it usually looks like that.
In them, there are always three of the diesel, two of them are always waiting.
That’s what you see below is the last one.
We also got very accurate data.
And the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is, is, as a rule, a backup system or a system, which only in small pieces here can consume.
Our soul was easy to say, okay,
The diesel will be back-up and the wind, the sun serves the last so that they can the larger anteil abbilden.
And if they want to go over zwanzig, thirty percent of renewable energy, so energy per jahr, not the power in the moment, then they have to den diesel off.
That is, at that moment they must ensure that renewable energies can take over the entire net.
That can be done, of course, only if they are gemanaged in some art and weise here.
No one in the world has done that yet.
Das gives &apos;s im small style, so you can also im auto their rasierer over a small switch server.
The people always ask me, what do you actually do in adlershof?
That’s going well.
But if they want to combine several of these shifts and they want to build a net, then it will be extremely complicated.
And our soul was just, we wanted to come on seven hundred to nine hundred percent renewable and then remains here yet this rest, the last rest, the last ten, the twenty-six percent renewable mit, that will be very, very expensive and that will also not work, that you can do that out of batteries.
That will be on one case an energy carrier, which then, hydrogen, methane, power to gas you know or sch, that will be then.
They then have to go on a seasonalspeicher and winter-summer and not just tag-night ausgleichen.
We just want to know what it is with a normal, stinknormalen electrochemical battery.
How far do you get there at all?
And then they have done a whole mix of simulations.
And have the wind and the sun and the last through-simulated and kamen to them ergebnis, a very exciting ergebnis that you face to the conventional system, which after twenty-two years requires an intermediate price of approximately fifty-six cents per kilowatt hour, approximately for four hundred and four hundred cents outcome.
That was the allerersten calculations before six jahren.
And then we said, okay,
It’s a toll, then we have a business model.
We are cheaper than the diesel system when the diesel price rises by five percent per year.
And then we have begun to negotiate with the insulaner.
Should it all get done?
Having negotiated with investors, I’ve been looking for a new gesellschafter.
We were and damals only five people, for one um the society to rebuild.
Here is the presentation again.
The brown is the conventional system, and the green is our system.
That our system also has a price rise, is due to the fact that we and yet zwanzig percent with diesel do and also a price rise on the other things do not break through.
And the power-utility, which the electricity supply companies on the island, has the meaning, that we find the whole toll.
We also want to support you, but we don’t believe that you can solve the technical problem.
And that’s why we have decided to build a hall in Berlin, in which we can so-call the electrical proportions of the insel im maßstab one to three quite accurately.
This means that we first sought to find the largest battery in the world.
Here is she.
They come naturally from Asia, in them fall from Japan.
And witzigerweise is she in the siebziger jahren at bbc mannheim, today ab, developed and was then auslizensiert an die japaner.
She is man can see, it’s a very, very large battery.
She has a megawatt power and can bring this power for six hours and that’s the battery that we have sozusagen simulationtechnisch got out.
And then they set up.
We also have one of these diesel-aggregate in the same size, as is there standing, in the hall brought, in fact the complete dynamic behavior of this netz, so in the hall looks it now so out, since the hint standing the diesel, here standing the big battery, here are the whole umrichter, with which we simulate the netz.
here we simulate the entire transmission system, the kilometers-physics of the cable, the sozusagen of the swinging behavior in the netz abzubilden.
And here you can see it all again.
We can also disable two hundred kilowatt photovoltaic on the netz.
Here we see das nochmal here we see nochmal den diesel, here nochmal the whole, individual aggregate.
and was we made have, since two thousandthree war the hall then fertig, until today two thousandthree almost everything, was here between the individual system an electronics, an software to develop war, we have made.
We are also not a battery manufacturer, but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the theme battery and the theme netz stands and everything dazwischen.
You must, of course, be able to communicate to the battery, you must also be able to communicate to the net, and this is very complicated.
The beautiful is an them theme that man on this insel im grunde genommen today all the vorwegnehmen can an problems that we will get if we want to raise our anteil of renewable.
So all this discussion, how will it be in the moment hin- and herbewegt, energy, how will it go, on the island we have for example for fünfundzwanzig to thirty percent exzessenergy, so we intervsen the wind and the sun abregeln.
Natural light is then offered by smart-grid an.
Also smart-grid, a riesenthema everywhere.
We can already start on the island, integrate electromobility, rumzufragen, can man since the last managen.
That is, if one is by seven hundred percent renewable, then one will not be able to do it without a storage.
man can by &apos;n smart-grid, man can by ausbau der netze, yes, that should man on one fall also tun, den anteil erhören, but man will never be able on storage complete verzichten.
And that’s so &apos;n bitchen the messaging.
Therefore, many people come and look there, just because you can see what problems you get.
If we disable the diesel, then you don’t have this rotiering mass, which causes a certain trägheit in the net.
And our European verbundnetz consists in the ground genommen only from the lauter rotierenden masses of large power plants, where the welle everywhere around the whole of Europe looks like dreht.
We look in this netz hinein, we see the fifty-six hertz, and if it is neunundvierzig coming neun hertz will, we fangen a couple of ventilches to open up, then it goes again a bit of merh dampf rein, then we come again up.
This is the system.
And, of course, it is the incredible trege.
If they do somewhere runterreißen, then dauert &apos; s &apos; ne weile.
The spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the net stabil.
And in time, they can react differently.
If they no longer have this rotierende mass, then they must replace it with power electronics and electrochemistry.
And we can rein-rausschalten with this large battery two milliseconds once.
Then you can see what enormous shifting possibilities there are.
And the message is now, we must give up on these rotierenden masses, if we sozusagen our ziele zwanzig, zwanzig, zwanzig percentage, zwanzig, thirty, thirty percentage, and so on, if we want to<unk> them at all,
Then we have to have our must-run capabilities im netz abbauen .
Must-run simply means, the powerwork runs mit, to keep the frequency.
Yes, that’s a riesendebatte im moment, zubau vom kohlekraftwerken, because we otherwise no, or gasturbinen, because that’s not going.
And we simply try to clarify that man can abbauen the capabilities, the must-run capabilities, by bringing man also electrochemical storage ins netz.
Fortunately, there is now a whole mixed study on this.
And for this purpose the people then always come and look at our trial stand on that, almost our inseltest stand.
And yes, the discussion is always about the question of how far one can take a bit of a far future forward there.
And many discussions that I had in the last six jahren were similar to the discussion that I had in the last thirty jahren on the topic of photovoltaic.
It does not go, is schwachsinn, childrenpielkram, we have everything rechnet, rechnet not.
Today we have thirty gigawatt photovoltaic in Germany.
This is predictive.
And I just assume that in the next thirty years we will have the same capacity of an electrochemical storage throughout the world.
It’s simple, so it’s going to come.
There will be such a whole mix of widerstands and strikes.
The beautiful is that I almost now in the last two jahren have experienced that the scientists put themselves on my site.
We have now received over ten million advanced projects, also um &apos; ne ten-megawatt-battery now ans deutsche netz zu klemmen.
This will take place in April next.
So, therefore, it is also noticed that since a trade is there and only from this abwehrhaltung hin zu ja, to the representation, hundred percent renewable stimmt ja.
And if you have a hundred percent renewable hat, then it’s like an autarkes system.
So far is in discussion always tried, these insulans, who make themselves autark, who have their own small netz, that hat and with our verbund nothing to do.
The phrase is very simple, but if they become completely independent of any fossil or uranium energy supplies that are thrown out and thrown to them somewhere in the world, then they are an island.
Then they use only yet that, what an sun and wind is there, where they live.
And that’s so a little our vision of a vernuftigen energy supply and I bin cradle-to-cradle also thankful that they’ve said, use solar energy.
And that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is.
And well, I just want to encourage you, in that mind, that you can calmly be a bit mad and also have a vision.
And you really have to be quite zäh to stay there, but I think that’s possible.
A lot of thanks.
As Steve Lopez, a columnist of the angels times, a tag through the streets in the center of the angels ging, hears is a wonderful music.
She came from a man, an African-American, sympathetic, rau, homeless, who played on a geige, who had only two saites.
Many of them will know the story, because from Steve’s article about it was later a book, which again was filmed, with Robert Downey junior as Steve Lopez and Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Contrabassist, who studied am juilliard-conservatory and whose promising career was tragically terminated early by his paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel left juilliard, erlitt a nervenusammenbruch and 30 years later lived er as an obdachloser on the streets of skid row in the center of the angels.
I emphehle them all, Steve's book to read or watch the film, so that they not only understand the wonderful connectivity that is between these two men, but also how the music recovers this connectivity half and how they eventually the instrument war, when this wortspiel is permitted, the mithalf, the nathaniel away from the street to rise.
I traf mr ayers im jahre 2008 , vor two jahren , in der walt disney concert hall .
He had just heard a presentation of Beethoven’s erster and fourth symphony and came behind the stage, to speak to me.
er sprach in a very heiteren and geselligen tone about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers are not in the baseball world series would create . and that everything because of the tückische passage of the first geige in the last sentence of beethovens vierter symphony .
We came up on the topic of music to talk . and a few days later I received an email, in the stand that Nathaniel was interested in geigenlearning at me.
I still have to mention that Nathaniel refused a medical treatment, because he had already been treated with electroshocks and thorazin and handschellen, a trauma that has pursued him throughout his life.
As follge of it is now<unk> vulnerable to these schizophrene phases. which are sometimes so bad, and er tagelang disappears, in the streets of skid row herumwandert, always exposed to this horror and the folterqualen seines their own geists.
And in just such a reizstadium found himself Nathaniel, when we started with our first undergraduate hours in the walt disney concert hall. he had this irre flackern in his eyes and seemed completely lost.
He spoke about the invisible demons and the rabbits, and about how someone wanted to poison him in his sleep.
I had anxiety, not meinetwegen, but I had anxiety that I could lose him, that he could disappear in one of his states, and that I could destroy him his relationship to the geige, if I begin, over tonleitern and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic geigenpedagogy to speak.
I also pretend to just play.
I played the first Satz of Beethoven's violin concert.
And while I played, trust me up that in nathaniels a complete change before it went.
It was, as if it is under them influence of an invisible drug stand, a chemical reaction, whose catalyst my game war.
Nathaniels manischer zorn turned into a quiet neugier and anmut.
And how through a wunder nahm is his geige and begann, after heir some ausschnitte of violin concerts to play and bat me then, they to play: mendelssohn, tschaikowski, sibelius.
We fingen then an, over music to talk, angefangen von bach over beethoven, brahms, bruckner and all the other bs, von bartók bis hin zu esa-pekka salonen.
And it became clear to me that it is not only an encyclopedic knowledge about music besaß, but it is also an enge personal relationship verband with it.
He spoke of her with a passion and an understanding that I otherwise know only from my colleagues in the Philharmonic of the Angels.
By playing music and through music sprach, war out of this paranoid, confused man, who just through the streets of the angels gezogen war, a liebenswerter, gebildeter, excellent, in juilliard ausgebildeter became a musician.
Music is medicine, music changes us.
for nathaniel means music seelische gesundheit.
Because the music allows it to him, his thoughts and wahnvorstellations with the help of his imagination and creativity to transform into something real.
And so entflieht is his existing.
I understand that this is precisely the essence of art.
This is exactly the reason why we make music: so that we can shape something, that is in us all, deep in our inner, our feelings, through our artistic lenses, through our creativity to reality.
and the reality jenes ausdrucks reaches us all, and moves, inspires, and unites us.
was nathaniel anging, so brought him the music back into a community of friends.
The erlösende kraft der Musik brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him, who recognized his talent and respected him.
And I’m going to music with Nathaniel again and again, no matter whether in the walt disney concert hall or in skid row, because it reminds me of why I became a musician bin.
A lot of thanks.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you very much.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I want to play something, that I unverschämterweise den cellisten gestohlen habe.
I hope you forgive me.
I have known a lot of fish in my life.
I have only two loves.
This first, that was more like a passionate affair.
It was a beautiful fish, well-schmeckend, good consistency, well-haltvoll, a bestseller on the speisekarte.
It was a fish.
Even better, it was grown in aquaculture after the alleged highest standards of sustainability.
He could also feel like he was selling him.
I had a relationship with this beauty over several months.
One tages rief of the head of the company an and fragte, whether I could at an event discuss about the sustainability of the farm.
&quot; of course &quot; , I said.
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem for our kitchen has become. how do we keep fish on our food cards?
In the last 50 years we have the meere fisch as we have slaughtered the wilderness.
It’s hard to overestimate that destruction.
90 percent of the big fish, der, which we love, the thunfische, the heilbutte, the lachse, the swordfisch, they are gathered together.
It is almost nothing else left.
So well or bad will be aquaculture, fishing, a part of our future.
many arguments dagegen . fischzuchtanlagen verschmutzen the environment , most of them at all , and they are inefficient , take we thunfisch . a great disadvantage .
er has a futter rating from 15 to 1.
That is, 15 pounds of wildfish are needed in order to get a pound of zucht-thunfish.
Not very sustainable.
It doesn’t taste very well either.
So here was finally a company that tried to do it right.
I wanted to support you.
am tag vor der Veranstaltung rief I den chef der öffentlichkeitsarbeit für die firma an .
We call him don.
&quot; don &quot;, I said, &quot; only about having the facts right, you are famous for it, so far out of it, so much more to build, that you are the environment not verschmutzt. &quot;
&quot; das stimmt &quot;, said er. &quot; we are so far out that the waste of our fish will be verteilt, not concentrated. &quot;
And then added er hinzu, &quot; we are in the ground a own world.
This futter rating from 2.5 to 1 &quot; , said er .
&quot; the best in the industry. &quot;
2.5 to one, great.
&quot; 2.5 zu eins was ? was füttert ihr ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable protein &quot; , said er .
&quot; great &quot; , said I . legte on .
And at this evening I laughed in bed and thought, "What to hell is a sustainable protein?"
also rief I am next tag, kurz vor der veranstaltung, don an.
I said : &quot; don , was zum beispiel are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said, er wisse das nicht. er will ask.
No, I phoneed with a few leuten in the company. no one could give me an ordinary answer. until I finally phoneed with them leiten biologen.
We call him don too.
&quot; don &quot; , said I, &quot; was zum beispiel are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Nun, er erwähnte some algen and some fischmehle, and then said er, hyhnchen-pellets.
I said : &quot; hyhnchen-pellets ? &quot;
er said : &quot; yeah , federn , haut , knochenmehl , rest , getrocknet and zu futter processed . &quot;
I said : &quot; how much percent eures futters is hyhnchen ? &quot; ,
In der annahme of<unk> two percent.
&quot; nun , das are about 30 percent &quot; , said er .
I said: &quot; don, what is sustainable there, hyhnchen an fish zu verfüttern? &quot;
There was a long break in the leitung and he said: &quot; there is simply too much hyhnchen on the world. &quot;
I am pleased with this fish.
No, no, because I am a self-righteous genießer and gutmensch bin.
That is even me.
No, I have mecht actually by this fish entliebt, because, I swear by god, the fish after this conversation after hyhnchen taste hat.
This second fish, that is another art of love history.
It is the romantic art, the art, at the man, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish, it is better man knows his fish.
I first ate it in a restaurant in Southern Spain.
A friend of a journalist has long talked about this fish.
She has somewhat scattered us.
I am on the table with a hellen, fast shimmernden white color.
Der Koch had sold him.
Stop two times.
Surprisingly war is still delicious.
Who can make a fish so good after it has been sold?
I can’t, but that guy can.
Nennen wir ihn miguel. in fact, it is called miguel.
And no, er has the fish not cooked and er is not a cook. at least on the art that she and I understood.
He is a biologist at veta la palma.
This is a fishaufzucht in the southwestern ecke spaniens.
She is nahe der Mündung des Flusses Guadalquivir.
Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hand of the Argentine.
They züchteten fleischrinder on them, what was im grunde feuchtgebiete.
They killed them by enthusiasticating the land.
They bauten this complicated folge of kanälen, and they drunk wasser out of the land out and out in the flow.
Now, they couldn’t prove that it was right, not economically.
And ecological war is a disaster.
Es brachte approximately 90 percent der vogel um, which for this ort many birds are.
And so, in 1982, a Spanish company with the environmental awareness of the land bought.
What did they do?
They have the fluss of the wassers omgekehrt.
They have buchstäblich den hebel umgelegt.
Instead of the wasser herauszudrängen benutzten sie die kanäle, um das wasser again hereinzuziehen.
They float the channels.
They create a 11,000 hectares of fish-off - barsch, meeräsche, garnele, aal - and at the same time have miguel and his company the ecological destruction completely omgekehrt.
The farm is incredible.
I think you haven’t seen anything like that yet.
They starren out on the horizon, which is a million miles away, and all they see are geflutete channels and these dense, ugly march.
I was there for no longer time with Miguel.
er is an incredible kerl, three you charles darwin and a share &quot; a crocodile to kiss &quot;.
Well, there were we and fought ourselves through the feuchtgebiete and I keuche and switze, have matsch up to my knien, and miguel holds in peace a biologyvorlesung.
Here you have a rare gleitary outcome.
The mineral needs of phytoplankton.
And here, here, there is a pattern of bündeln, which reminds him of the Tanzanic giraffe.
It turns out that miguel the greatest part of his career im mikumi national park in Africa verbracht hat.
I wonder how he has become such a fish-expert.
He said, “I don’t know anything about fish.
I am an expert for relationships. &quot;
And then it goes and falls into more gerides of rare birds and algen and seltsamen wasserplants.
And you understand me not false, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotical community unplugged, so in the art.
It’s great, but I was in love.
And my head became weak over this wrapped piece of delicious fish that I had am vorabend.
I said, &quot; miguel, how does it come that your fish so good taste? &quot;
It was shown on the Algen.
&quot; I know, young, the algen, the phytoplankton, the relationships, that is incredible.
Do you eat your fish?
How is the futtervaluation? &quot;
Now, it is fährt fort to tell me that it is so a reichhaltiges system that the fish eat, what they would eat in the wild.
The pflanzliche biomasse, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, and the fish are füttert.
The system is so healthy, it is completely selbsterneuernd.
There is no futter.
Do you hear of a farm that doesn’t feed its animals?
later am tag fuhr I on this foundation with miguel herum and I fragte it, I said: &quot; for a ort that seems so natural to be &quot;, other than any farm, on which I was war, &quot; how mist you success? &quot;
In that moment it was, as if a film director had wanted a scene change.
and we bogen um die ecke and uns bot themselves the incredible view, a thousand and thousand open pinker flamingos, a buchstäblich pinker teppich so far as the auge reicht.
&quot; das is success &quot; , said er .
&quot; shau dir her beuche an, pink.
she schlemmen . &quot;
I was completely confused.
I said : &quot; miguel , schlemmen sie not your fish ? &quot;
&quot; and &quot; , said er .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern an die bird .
Nun, letztes jahr were on this foundation 600,000 birds, more than 250 different species.
Today, it has become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserve in all over Europe.
I said: &quot; miguel, is a good gedeihender vogelbestand not the last, that man wants to have on a fischaufzucht? &quot;
He shrinked his head, no.
He said: &quot; we bauen extensiv an, not intense.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the garnels.
The garnelen fressen the phytoplankton.
is pinker also der bauch the better the system. &quot;
Well, let them overthink, a farm that does not feed their animals, and a farm that does not feed their success in their health.
A fish, but also a bird reserve.
Oh, and besides, these flamingos von vornherein should not even be there.
She brüten in a town 240 kilometers away, where the bodenbeschaffenheit is better for the nestbau.
One morning they fly 240 kilometers to the farm.
And one day they fly 240 kilometers back.
They do that because they can follow the gestrified white line of the landstraße a92.
I am serious.
I had a art journey of the pinguine presented, so look I miguel an.
I said : &quot; miguel , fly them 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them then 240 kilometers back am abend ?
Do you do it for the kids? &quot;
It’s like I’d just sing a song by Whitney Houston.
he said: &quot; no. they do that, because the essen is better. &quot;
I have not mentioned the top of my loving fish, and I have not mentioned the top of my loving fish, and I have not mentioned the top of my loving fish, and I have not mentioned the top of my loving fish, and I have not mentioned the top of my loving fish.
It is this pissende, verkohlte taste.
I’m cooking fast not with it.
And yet, when I tried her in this restaurant in southern Spain, I did not taste her after fischhaut at all.
She smecked sweet and pure, as if a man would take a bissen from the ocean.
I erwähnte das against miguel and er nickte.
He said, “The height acts like a swamm.”
She is the last abwehr before something in the body enters.
She has developed itself in the course of evolution, in the uncleannesses. &quot;
And then he added his insight : &quot; but our wasser has no impurities . &quot;
A farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm, a farm.
And then it became clear to me, when you say, a farm that has no uncleanties, undertrains er gewaltig, for the water that flows through this farm comes from the flow of guadalquivir herein.
It is a flow that all the things lead with it, from which the flowes tend to lead with it, chemical pollutants, abfluss of pollutants.
And if it has been fought through the system and this is left is the wasser sauberer, as if it has come here.
The system is so healthy, it is cleansing the water.
So not only a farm that does not feed its animals, not only a farm that measures its success in the health of its rabbits, but a farm that is literally a water preparation facility, and not only for these fish, but also for you and me.
For if the water flows out, it is versinkt in the Atlantic.
A tropfen im ocean, I know, but I take it, and that they should also tun, because this love story, as romantic as it is, is also uncertain.
You could say that she is a recipe for the future good food, whether we speak of barsch or fleischrindern.
What we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture, from one, in which foods actually taste good.
But for many people, it’s a bit too radical.
We are not realists, we are genießer, we are lovers.
we love wochenmärkte . we love small familybetriebe . we talk about regional foodstuffs . we essen bio .
And if they claim that these are the things that the future guter food guarantee someone stands somewhere up and says: &quot; hey leute, I love pinke flamingos, but how will they feed the world?
How will they feed the world? &quot;
Can I be honest?
I don’t like this question.
No, no, because we’re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just.
A billion people are hungry today.
A billion – that’s more than it’s overwhelming – due to the crasser inequalities in the distribution, not the total production.
Well, I don’t like this phrase because it has the logic of our nahrungssystems that last 50 years over certain.
füttere getreide an pflanzenfresser , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel an monokulturen , chemikalien an die erde , hyhnchen an fish , and the whole time has the agricultural industry simply asked : &quot; if we more leute billiger feed , how terrible can that already be ? &quot;
It was the justification, it was the business plan of the American agriculture.
We should call them, what they are, a gewerbe in development, a gewerbe, that quickly ecological capital auffrisst, that exactly this production enables.
It is not agriculture, it is not agriculture.
Our cornkammer is today bedroht, not due to abnehmender zufuhr, but due to abnehmender resources,
Not by the latest mehdrescher- and tractor-erfindungen, but by fruitful land, not by pumping, but by fresh water, not by kettensägen, but by forest, and not by fischerboote and netze, but by fish in the more.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let us begin with the question: How will we feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create conditions that each community is capable of feeding itself?
To do so, don’t look at the agricultural industry model for the future.
It’s really alt, and it’s finished.
capital, chemie and machinen stands darin obenan und es hat nothing really goods zum essen produciert.
Let’s take a look at the ecological model.
That’s the fact that two billion years of work experience has been recovered.
Look at miguel an, bauern like miguel,
betriebe, which are not welten for themselves, betriebe, which restore rather than rebuild, betriebe, which extensive cultivate rather than just intense, bauern, which are not only erzeuger, but experts for relationships.
Because they are the ones who are also experts in taste.
And if I really ehrlich bin you are a better love than I am you will be.
They know that it is right to me, for if the future is good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you .
If I want to bring them a thing about today, it is that the totality of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of their individual parts and instead of thinking about information overload I want them to think about how we can use information so that patterns arise and we so recognize trends that otherwise would not become visible.
So, what we see here is a typical sterbediagramm nach alter angeordnet.
The program, which I use here, is a small experiment.
It is called pivot and what I can do with pivot is that I can filter after a certain todesursache, say we accident.
And immediately I see another pattern that rises.
And that’s because in the middle area here the people are the most active and they are here the drüben am gebrechlichsten.
We can take a step further out and order that daten then new and see that circulatory diseases and cancers that are common suspects, but not for one.
If we now go on and sort after alter, say we 40 years or a young man, we see that the accident is even the main cause over which the people should make themselves sorge.
And whoever researches further sees that is<unk> this in men's zutrifft.
They also recognize that the sight of information and data in this weise very an schwimmen in a lively information graphic erinnert.
And if we can do this for rohdaten, why not for the content itself?
was we now here have are the title images of each individual &quot; sports illustrated &quot; , which jemals were printed .
It’s all here, it’s all online.
You can like to test it after my vortrag in their zimmern.
With pivot you can enter in a jahrzehnt.
They can enter into a certain jahr.
They can jump directly to a certain output.
If I look here, I see the athletes who appear in this exhibition and the athletes.
I bin a lance armstrong fan, so click I hierhin wodurch me all the expenses show in which lance armstrong will be mentioned.
Now, if I just want to get a greater overview, I could think &quot; ok, what if I think me all with them theme fahrradfahren ansehe ? &quot;
So I’m going a step back and expanding it visually.
I see Greg lemond.
And so you get an idea that if you are on this art informationen durchsucht, gezielter, breiter, reinzoomen, rauszoomen, then you are not sucht or surft not simply.
You do something that is actually a little different.
It is something dazwischen and we think it changes the art and weise how informationen can be used.
I want to put this idea a little further into practice with somewhat was a little mad.
What we have done here is, we have made each individual wikipediaseite genommen and reduced it to a small summary.
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol for the range from which it comes.
The top 500 of the most popular wikipediasites.
But even in this limited view we can a mix of things tun.
Soon we get an impression about the themes that are the most popular on Wikipedia.
I will be now the theme &apos; governance &apos; choose .
nun, after me I &apos; regierung &apos; chosen have acknowledged me that the wikipediakategories, which are most so decken time magazines &quot; menschen des jahres &quot; are.
This is really important, as this is a recognition that is not steckt in a single Wikipedia site.
This is only to be noticed when you take a step back and look at it all.
Schauend on a certain of these summaries can I then in the thema time magazines &quot; men des jahres &quot; go in, and all together see.
If I look at all these people, I realize that the majority of them are government officials. some come from the science. some, even less, come from the economy. here is my chief. and one comes from the music field.
And interestingly, Bono is also a ted prize winner.
So we can now jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners.
man sees, we surf im netz the first time as if it is also really a netz is, not only von seite zu seite, but a lot of abstract.
And so I would like to show them was other to show what a small surprise could be.
This is the New York Times website.
pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really no browser, but you can see this web site -- and we bring this zoom-technology to each individual website like this.
I can also take a step back and jump directly to a specific section.
That’s why it’s important, because one can only by looking at the web sites in this art and weise, the entire internet-circuit on the same art and weise.
I can also in my course hineinzoomen in a certain zeitrahmen .
Here is the stand of the entire demonstration that I have held until herein.
And I can resume all that I have seen so far, again.
And, if I again take a step out and look at everything, I can arrange my course after my such-vergangenheit. here, I have searched for the 'notistic', here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
And from here I can go into the seat and call her again.
It is a metaphor that is repeatedly used, and every time it makes it the total image greater than the sum of the datenteile.
In this moment, in this world, we think that dates are a fluch.
We speak of the fluch of information.
We are talking &quot; ertrinken in informationen &quot; .
What if we could circumvent this situation and put the internet on the head, so that instead of always going from one to the other, we would begin to be able to go from many things to many things, and thus patter recognize what otherwise would be hidden?
If we can do this, then this up-to-date datenfalle,<unk> a new which is more meaningful informationen will be.
And, instead of just moving in informationen, we can get the knowledge of it.
And if we know know, then we may even be able to pull wisdom out of it.
I listen to it, thank you very much.
I wuchs with a belonging portion science fiction on .
In my schulzeit I fuhr with them bus zur schule, one tag one hour per route.
And my nose always stood in a book, a science-fiction-book, that my thoughts in other worlds entered and on erzählerische weise my deep in me sitzende, unersättliche neugier satisfied.
This curiosity showed itself also darin that I always, if I didn’t in the school war, through the forests streunte, wanderte and &quot; try &quot; gather, frösche and schlangen and käfer and teichwasser, everything after house brachte and under them a microscope is viewed.
I was a total scientist, you know.
It was always about the attempt to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible outsourced.
And my love for science fiction seemed in my environment widerzuspiegeln, because damals, in the late 60ern, flogen us to the mouth and erforschten the thiefsee.
jacques cousteau kam in our wohnroom with his fascinating sendings, which uns tiere and orte and a world voller wunder zeigten, which we uns before could not have imagined.
I think it’s a good idea to play a science-fiction role.
And I was an artist.
I could paint, I could paint, I could paint.
And since there were neither video games nor this overtake with computer-generated films nor the whole image language in the media landscape, I had to create the images in my head.
If we as children a buch lasen, nahmen we the description of the authors and projected them on the leinwand in our köpfen.
My reaction to it was das zeichnen und malen von außerirdischen, außerirdischen welten, robotern, space shiffen and all so was.
In the matheunterricht was I constantly vom lehrer erwischt, as I, hinterm lehrbuch hidden, herummalte.
The creativity had to stop somehow out.
And there happened something interesting. was me namely an jacques cousteaus sendungen fascinated, war der gedanke an uns completely unknown world here on our erde itself.
I would<unk> never reach an outer world with a spacecraft. that seems quite unlikely to me.
But here was a world that I could actually enter, here on the ground, and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all that I had always imagined when I had read this book.
So I decided, when I was 15 war, to become a taucher.
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada, 1 000 km from the nearest ocean.
But I don’t let myself be enthusiastic about it.
I nerve my father, until it was finally a tauchschule in Buffalo, New York, outfindig had done, exactly on the other seite of the border, where we live.
I made my tauchschein in a pool der ymca midten im winter in buffalo, New York.
The ocean but, a real ocean, bekam I only two years later to face, when we go to California zogen.
Since then, in the 40 jahren, which are inzwischen verstrichen, I have approximately 3,000 hours under wasser verbracht.
And I have learned that the world of thiefsee, even in the flacheren ozeanen, is so rich and fascinating to live, as we are really hardly to imagine.
The fantasy of nature does not know any boundaries, all in its gegensatz to our own, complaint human imagination.
To the present day I feel my deepest fear for what I see on my tauchgängen.
And my love for the ocean holds an, with the same intensity as eh and je.
When I then saw myself as an adult a beruf aussuchte, it was the filmmaking.
The best way to tell stories, with my bedürfnis, to create images, to unite, is to tell stories, with my bedürfnis, to create images.
As a child, I’m constantly drawing comicbooks and so.
Also were films der weg, pictures and stories to gather together. das passte together.
Of course, they were the stories that I aussuchte, from the science-fiction area: &quot; terminator &quot;, &quot; aliens &quot;, and &quot; abyss &quot;.
bei &quot; abyss &quot; I could connect my preference for the underwater world and the tauchen with them filmmaking .
So, almost my two lectures broke up.
Something interesting passed at &quot; abyss &quot; : about a erzählerisches problem in this film to solve - and that is, we must so a art flüssiges wasserwesen create - , griffen we on computergenerated animation , cg , back .
It was the first computer-generated soft-surface-figur that was in a film to see war.
The film carried no money, exactly speaking, it was just a bit of its production costs, but I noticed something fascinating: the audience throughout the world war as hypnotized from the magic, which ausging from it.
Arthur Clarke's law is known to be advanced technology and Zauberei is no longer to distinguish from each other.
They also saw something magical.
And I found that incredibly exciting.
And I thought me : &quot; wow, that must necessarily be involved in the film art. &quot;
Also gingen we in &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; , my next movie , even much further .
Together with ilm we created there the type out of liquid metal. the success hing all of that ab, how this effect would come.
And it worked . again we had created something magical . and the effect in the public was dieselbe . however we have already invested a little more money with the film .
Based on these two experiences, a whole new world was achieved, a whole new world of creativity for filmschaffende.
I also founded a company, together with my good friend Stan Winston, who was to jener zeit the best make-up and creature-designer war.
The fundamental idea of this company was that the phase analoger proces with optical druckern etc. to overtake and begin with digital production.
That’s what we then do and give us so a time-long a wettbewerbsvorteil.
But not the 90's years we notice that we in creature- and character-design - what we the company and actually founded had - too slowly vorankamen.
I had this piece &quot; avatar &quot; written, that the messlatte in sachen visueller effects and computergenerierter effects in a whole new height should be shipped, with realistic human, ausdrucksvollen character, that mittels cg were produced. and the hauptfiguren should be all cg. and the world should be cg.
But the messlatte pushed very well back. and the people in my company told me that we are not currently in the lowest position to create that.
So also verschob I das and made this other film about the great shiff, that undergeht.
dem filmstudio habe ich das als &quot; romeo and julia on a shiff &quot; sold. it became a love film epic ausmaßes, a passionate film.
Insgeheim but I really wanted to zum echten wrack der titanic hinabtauchen.
I have made the film.
That’s the truth, but the studio didn’t know it.
I have convinced them by saying, &quot; we tauchen zu dem wrack. we film das real wrack.
We will show it in the opening sequence of the films.
Das is ungeheuer important . it is a good suspension for marketing . &quot;
And I convince you to finance an expedition.
It sounds crazy, but this goes back again to the fact that the imagination itself can create a reality.
We then actually create six months later a reality, in which I find myself in a Russian tauchboot again, four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic, and me the real Titanic through a bullauge look.
That was not a movie, not a HD, that was real.
So, that has really umgehauen me.
And the preparations for this were enormous. we had to build cameras and screenshots and everything possible.
And I am convinced how much these thiefseetauchgänge, a world-raummission, resembled.
They were also hochtechnisch and bedurften umfangreicher planung.
man steigt in this capsule, then schwebt man in this dark, hostile environment hinunter, where no hope on retung exists, if man is not himself back creates.
And I thought me, &quot; wow, that’s exactly as if I’d be in a science fiction film.
That’s really cool. &quot;
I was regelrecht besessen vom erforschen der tiefsee.
It was all, it was all, it was all, it was all, it was all, it was all, it was all, it was all, it was all.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn’t give me.
For, you know, I could imagine a being for which we could then create a visual effect, but I could not imagine what I would see outside the windows.
In some of the following expeditions, I have seen things in thermal sources, and sometimes things that I have not seen before, and sometimes things that no one had seen before, and for which the science at the time when we saw them had not yet found a word.
That also had me properly umgeworfen, and I wanted more.
And then I made a little unusual decision.
after dem erfolg von &quot; titanic &quot; said I me, &quot; okay, I will my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in Hollywood on eis leg and will for a weile full-time-forscher. &quot; I will my hauptberuf as a filmmaker in Hollywood on eis leg and will for a weile full-time-forscher. &quot;
And then we begin, we tauchten zur &quot; bismarck &quot;, and explore them with a robot vehicle.
We return to the wrack of the Titanic.
We nahmen small robots, which we had built, which had a fiber glass cable.
Our intention war, hineinzutauchen and sich das innere des schiffs anzusehen, which is not zuvor getan become war.
No one had it das innere des wracks erkundet . man had yet no means for it . also developed we the necessary technology .
I sit on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on
And I fly with a small robot vehicle through the gänge des schiffs.
I bediene it is actually only, but my consciousness is within des fahrzeugs.
It felt like I was physically within the schiffswracks of the Titanic anwesend.
That was the surrealest form of a déjà-vu, which I have experienced. for before I each um an ecke bog, I always knew already, what would appear in the lightkegel of the fahrzeugs, since I monatelang over the film set walked war, as we the film drehten.
The set was a exact copy of the baupläne des schiffs.
This was also a very strange experience.
She made me this telepresence-erlebnis conscious that man solch roboterhafte avatare use and so the own consciousness in the fahrzeug, in this other form of existence can confuse.
It was really ungeheuer tiefgreifend.
And<unk> even a small look at what might happen in a few decades if you have a cyborg-body to explore something or other things to do, in all possible post-human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science-fiction-fan.
After these expeditions we began to do what we had seen below, really appreciate to learn, for example, these tiefseequellen, where we saw these incredibly verblüffenden tiere.
They live with the help of chemosynthese.
They do not exist in a system based on sunlight, as we do tun.
And this is how you see the animals, who directly next to a 500 degrees Celsius call that they can survive there.
To the same time I was also very interested in space science, which was again the science-fiction influence from my kindness.
And so I land with the people who are interested in the space and who have to do with the NASA and who sit and plan the right world space missions. they drive to Russia, pass through the mission of the biomedical protocol as well as all the drum and the drum, then fly to the international world space station and take our 3D camera systems with.
That was fascinating.
But I still loved it beyond that I world scientists with us in the thiefsee nahm.
I nahm them with and granted them access to the world below: astrobiologists, planet scientists, people who were interested in such extreme situations. I nahm them to the quellen mit, so that they could look around, take tests and test instruments, and so on.
We drehten documentary films, operated but actually science, more precisely: world space science.
So the circle closed between my existence as a science-fiction fan, damals as a kind, and the implementation into the reality.
In the course of this journey of discovery I have learned a menge.
I have a menge over science learned. but I now think you<unk>, a director must also be able to lead, a leader to be like a ship captain or so.
But I don’t understand much of the lead before I begin this expedition.
For at a certain point I had to say to myself: &quot; what do I actually do here?
Why do I do that? &quot; What does it come out? &quot;
These crazy movies don’t bring us any money.
We do not play just the cost of production one. von ruhm no spur.
all think, I know between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; davongelaufen and would have me somewhere the nail on a handtuch am beach gefeilt .
I have made all these films, these documentary films, for a very small audience.
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money.
du machst is um der Aufgabe will, um der Herausforderung will, and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists. du machst is des découckerrausches because, and because of the seltsamen connection, which arises when a small group of people forms a team.
Because we have done all these with only 10 to 12 leuten, who have worked together uninterrupted for years. sometimes we were 2 to 3 months each other on see.
And in this community, one recognizes that the most important thing is the respect that one has before each other, because one has accomplished a task that one cannot explain to anyone else.
If man an land returns and says, &quot; we must be tun, the fiberglass, the schallschwächung, and the whole drumherum, the whole technique, and the difficulties, the human power, if man on that works &quot;, then you can simply not explain the others.
It creates a bond, a mutual respect.
When I also come back to my next film &quot; avatar &quot; zu drehen, I tried denselben leadership style anzuwenden, namely that man his team respects and is im gegenzug his respect deserves.
Thus, the dynamics have really changed.
We drehten &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique, which is before not yet had.
Awesome excitement.
An approximately challenge.
And we became for a zeithrum of four and a half jahren to a real family.
Through this, my art has changed, making films, completely.
There was a lot of people who thought we would have had this oceanwesen and really good-made and transported on the planet Pandora.
For me was it more a principle art, my job to tun, the actual process that has changed in ergebnis.
What can we also close out of all of them?
What lessons have we learned?
I believe, an erster star stands the neugier.
It is the most powerful human attribute.
Our imagination is a power that can even create a reality.
And the observance of your teams is more important than all the lorbeer of this world.
To me come young filmmaker, who says: &quot; give me a rat, how I can do something like that. &quot;
And I say: &quot; do not shake yourself into.
You are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself, you are not saying yourself.
die nasa has so a lieblingssatz : &quot; scheitern is no alternative . &quot;
But in the art and in the research, the failure must be an alternative, for there it is guaranteed that it is a trust.
No important undertakings, that innovation desires, have become engaged without risk.
You have to be prepared to take such risks.
Das ist der gedanke, den I like to give them mit auf den weg. scheitern is durchaus an alternative, angst but is no. thank you.
Today I’m talking to you about energy and climate.
And that may be something surprising, because my full-time employment at the stiftung is mainly about impfstoffe and saatgut dreht, in order to enable the things that we have to invent and deliver to enable the wealth of 2 billion a better life.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, precisely even more important than for anybody else on that planet.
Climate change means that their waters will not grow over many jahre. is we too much or too little rain. that things will change so much as their fragile environment cannot stand.
It leads to uncertainty, it leads to unruhen.
Therefore, a climate change will become horrible for you.
In addition, the energy price is very important for you.
Tatsache is that, if you could only from a matter of the price decrease, the armuts decrease would be the energy at the far most efficient.
Now, the energy price has fallen over the time.
In fact, the fortschrittsgesellschaft is based on energy-ortschritten.
The cohlerevolution triggered the industrial revolution an and even in the 20th century there was a rapid fall in the electricity price and therefore we have cohlschränke, air conditioning, we can recover modern materials and so many things tun.
We are also in a wonderful situation with a stream in the rich world.
But, if we lower the price – let us halb the price – we encounter a new barrier and this barrier hangs with co2 together.
CO2 heats the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually quite clear.
They summieren das ausgestoßene co2 , which leads to temperature rise and this temperature rise has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and<unk> worse , the indirect consequences that the natural ecosystems can not adapt to rapid changes and thus the entire systems collapse .
Now, the exact connection between a CO2 anti-stieg and the resulting temperature change and where their further follows are, since there are some unclearities, but not very many.
And there is<unk> unclearness about how bad these follows will be. but they will be extremely bad!
I’ve asked the top scientists several times : &quot; should we really runter on nahe null come ?
Is it not half or a quarter enough? &quot;
The answer is: until we get null, the temperature will continue to rise.
That’s why it’s a big challenge.
It’s quite different than to say, we have a 3.5 m high lkw, which is under a 3 m bridge her must. den can man then almost darunter her quetschen.
It must be down to zero, down to zero.
Now, we shoot every year a mix of carbon dioxide out, over 26 billion tons.
Each American is about 20 tons. men aus armen ländern, less than one.
The average is approximately 5 tons per one on the planet.
And somehow we have to bring about changes that do null down.
So far, it is constantly managed.
Only different economic changes have affected it at all and we have to go from rapid anstieg to reduction and to a reduction up to zero.
This equation has four factors. a bit of multiplication. they have this ding links - co2 - that they want to bring the direction null and that will be dependent on the number of people, on the services that each manch im average nutzt, on the average energy for one service and on the co2 that pro energy unity is issued.
Let us also look at one factor individually and consider how we get that to zero.
Probably one of these zahlen must come very nah and null.
Nun das is a basic algebra, but we go it is wrong through.
First we have the population.
Today there are 6.8 billion people living.
And it is crying to 9 billion up. that moves to 9 billion.
If we are very successful with new pollutants, the health care and reproductive medicine are we could probably decrease about 10 percent to 15 percent, but at the time we see a stagnation about 1.3 percent.
The second factor is the services we use.
Das umfasst alles, die nahrung, die wir essen, kleidung, fernsehen, heizung.
These are very good things and armutsreduction means to make these services accessible to everyone on that planet.
It’s great that this number is rising.
In the rich world, in the oberen billion, we could<unk> make abstraction and use less, but in the average, this number will increase every year and thus, in total, more than twice, the number of services that will be provided per person.
Here we see a very basic service. there is too house light so that you can read the housework?
And these students do not have it, so they go out and read their schoolwork under their street light.
Now, with efficiency, they, the energy for service, there is finally good news.
We have something that doesn’t rise,
Due to different successes in the light sector, through other autotypes, through new methods in the housebau, there are many services whose energy expenditure can be reduced by about 90 percent.
in other services, such as the manufacture of düngemitteln, 105 00: 05: 56,000 -- &amp; gt; 00: 05: 58,000 or the air transport or air transport, the play space for improvements is much smaller.
In total, if we are optimistic, we may get a reduction about a factor 3 or<unk> even about a factor 6 .
But with the first three factors, we are now moving from 26 billion to<unk> 13 billion tons. and that’s simply not enough!
We also see the fourth factor an -- and this will be a key factor -- that is the menge an CO2 , which is emitted per energy unit.
It is the question of whether you can get that to zero.
If you burn the coal, no.
If you burn ergas: no.
fast every herstellungsmethode for strom emittiert heutzutage co2 , except for the renewable energy and nuclear energy .
So what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system.
We need energywunder.
If I do not mean the concept &quot; wunder &quot; benutze, I do not mean the unpossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. the PC is a miracle.
The internet and its services are a miracle.
The men here have to the development many of these wonders contributed.
Normally there is no deadline that you need a miracle up to a certain date.
Normally, man stands almost only daneben and some come, others don’t.
In this case, however, we have to give full gas and get a miracle in very short time.
Now, I’m worried, how can I really break it out?
Is there a natural illustration, a demonstration, which embodies the representation of man here?
I remember an last year, when I broke mosquitoes and somehow could the people do it.
The idea was for them really greifbar, they know that there are people who live with mosquitoes.
For energy, I am here.
I decided that the freilassen of glühwürmchen would be my this year’s contribution to the environment here.
Here are also a few natural glühwürmchen.
I’ve been assured that they’re not kissing, they’re probably not going to leave the glass.
Now, there are all possible game solutions like these, but they bring all not a lot.
We need solutions, either one or more that have an unimaginable scaleerung and unimaginable reliability. and although there are many directions in which people look after, I really see only five that can afford these great demands.
I have gezeiten, geothermal, fusion and biofuels ausgelassen.
These may allow a moderate contribution and if they are better allow than I erwarte, it would be the toll, but my kernussage here is that we have an all the five to work, and we can not give up any of them because they are uns einschüchtern, because all have significant problems.
Let’s look at us first that burn fossil fuels an, burn of either coal or erdgas.
What man there must do, it may seem simple, but that is not. man must all the co2 that after them burn out of them schornstein comes, infangen, under druck verflüssigen and then somewhere lagern and hope that it remains there.
There are some pilot projects that create that at a 60% - 80% level, but it will be very difficult to get to 100%. and an agreement for the storage of CO2 to<unk> is a big challenge. but the biggest problem here is the storage time question.
Who will secure it?
Who can guarantee something, which is literally a lot of billions of times greater than any art of mull, the one can imagine of nuclear and other things?
This is a mixed volume.
This is also a harte nuss.
The next is nuclear energy.
The cost, especially in highly regulated countries, is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high. the frage is high.
And what do you do with them?
Because although it is not very large, there is a menge bedenken.
Three very difficult problems, which may be solvable, and on which one should therefore work.
I summarized the last three of the five.
These are the renewable energies, as they are often called.
And they also have -- although it’s a toll that they don’t need fuel -- they have some nausea.
On the one hand, the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically smaller than that of powerworks.
They are energy farms, man speaks of a lot of square kilometers, a thousand times more flood than a normal power plant.
Furthermore, these sources are subject to interruptions:
The sun doesn’t seem the whole tag, it doesn’t seem even one tag and the same weht even the wind isn’t constant.
Therefore, if you are dependent on these sources, you must have a way to get that energy even in times when it is not available.
If, for example, we say that the energy source lies outside of the land, they do not only need the technology, they also need to deal with the risk that the energy from where else herkommt.
And there is the storage problem.
And to show the dimension, I have looked at all kinds of batteries that are manufactured, looked at: those for cars, computers, mobile phones, pocket lights, for everything. and that I have compared with the menge of electronic energy that the world uses. I found out that all batteries that we are now producing, could be less than 10 minutes of total energy storage.
We also need a big breakthrough here, something that about a factor 100 will be better than the approaches to the time.
It’s not impossible, but it’s not so easy.
if one tries to bring these underbroken quellen over say we 20 % - 30 % des consumption.
If you want to rely 100 percent on it, you need an incredible wunderbattery.
Now, where should we go: what is the right approach?
One &quot; Manhattan project &quot; ? how come we ans ziel ?
What we need are many firms that work on it. hundreds.
In one of these five areas we need at least 100 people.
Many of them will say, ‘They’re crazy, that’s good.
I believe, here in the ted group there are many who are already engaged there.
Bill gross has several firms, among others a name esolar the great solarthermaltechnologien hat.
vinod khosla invested in a dozen companies that make great things and have interesting opportunities and I try to support them.
Nathan Myhrvold and I fund a company that,<unk> surprisingly, the nuclear approach is persecuted.
There are some innovations in the nuclearbereich; modular, liquid.
The development has in this industry vor einiger zeit stopped, so it is not a big surprise that some good concepts herumliegen.
The term “terrapower” means that instead of a teils of uranium, we decide to burn the 99% of uranium, we decide to burn the 99% of uranium, we decide to burn the 99% of uranium, we decide to burn the 99% of uranium.
That’s a pretty mad idea.
But in fact, you had long thought about it, but you could not reasonably simulate, whether it would work, but since there is a modern supercomputer, you can simulate it and see that: yes! with the right material, it looks so out that it works.
And because you burn this 99%, the cost profile is much better.
In fact, it burns the mull, and it can even use the abfall of the heutigen reactoren as anthrobus.
Instead of getting over the den kopf to zerbrechen, burn it is easy. a great thing.
The uranium is gradually consumed, a bit like a kerze.
They see that it is an art säule, often referred to as &quot; wandernde welle reactor &quot;.
It really solves the fuel problem.
Here is a picture of an ort in Kentucky.
“Man has the part, which is burned today, taken out also says it is used uranium.
For hundreds of jahren an.
And if man ozeanwasser cheap and easy to filter, man gets plenty of fuel for the rest of the planet’s lifetime.
They know there are still a lot of challenges, but it is an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come to vorwärts.
Let us consider ourselves how we should measure our success.
How should our witness look?
Now, we go bis ans ziel, which we must<unk>, and then we talk about the Zwischenschritt.
Many speak of a 80% reduction by 2050.
It is really important that we get there.
The remaining 20 percent will be produced in the Armenian land, as well as still a little agriculture. hopefully will waldrohdung and zement until there will be clean.
Also, in order to<unk> this 80 percent, the industrial states, including countries such as China, have to completely replace their electricity generation.
The other note says, if we use the null-emission technology, if it is used in all developed countries and we are on them way, they are to get them rest.
This is super important.
This will be a key part of this Zeugnisses.
If we go back from there, how should the 2020 witness look?
It should again include the two elements.
We should use the efficiency measures to bring reduction on the way. the less we emite, the less the CO2 sum will be and thus the temperature.
But in fact, this note for the things we do, which do not lead to the great reductions, is just the same, or even a little less important as the others, which represents the speed of innovation for this breakthrough.
These breakthroughs must be measured with full gas and that can be measured: in firmenzahlen, in pilot projects and regulatory changes.
There are many great books on this topic.
das al gore buch &quot; we have the wahl &quot; and david mckays &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
They go it really through and create a righteousness, in which this breadth can be discussed, because we need the support of all seits.
There are a few things that must be gathered together.
That is a desire.
It is a very concrete desire that we will inherit this technology.
If they only give me a wish for the next 50 years, I could choose the president, a pollutant, and I love it, or I could choose this wish, the lautet, the halbierter energy price without co2 will be invented.
This has the greatest impact.
If we don’t do this desire, the grabbing between long-term and short-term thinking people will be terrible, between the U.S. and China, between the Armenian and the rich land. and almost all the lives of these 2 billion will be much worse.
Should we also have to tun?
Which measures do I call for?
We need to invest for more research funds.
If countries encounter in orten like Copenhagen, they should not just talk about CO2.
They should discuss this innovation strategy and they would be shocked by the ridiculous little money that will be spent on these innovative approaches.
We need marktanreize, co2 steuern, cap & amp; trade something that a price signal creates.
We need to spread the message.
We need to conduct a more rational and comprehensive dialogue, and also the things that the government will do.
It’s an important wish, but I think we can fulfill it.
A lot of thanks.
A lot of thanks.
Thank you . thank you !
Thank you very much. only for terrapower to understand a little better -- first, can you give us an idea of the size order of this investment?
Bill Gates: to perform the simulation on a supercomputer, all the great scientists to get what we have done, we only need a few 10 millionen. and even if we have tested our materials in a Russian reactor, to make sure that it works reasonably, is man only in the 100 millionen.
The difficult step is the construction of the first reactors, more billions to find, the regular and the place that actually the first of them.
As soon as the first is finished, if it is so running as promised, then everything is quite clear, because the economicity, the energy density is so different from the nuclear energy, as we know it.
That means deep in the boden to build fast like a vertical seal of nuclear fuels, this consumed uranium and then begins the process up and works further down?
bg : exactly . today they have to fill the reactor always neu , so there are a lot of leute and a lot of controls , that schief can go . this ding wo man it open and sachen in- or outbringt . that's not good !
But if you have a very cheap fuel, you can fill it for 60 years—think a seal—that you will be buried, without all the complexities.
And it sits there and burns 60 years long and then it is finished.
A nuclear reactor, which offers itself a solution for the mull.
bg: yeah, now, what happens with the mull: you can let it sit - there is much less mull with this method - then take it and pack it into the next reactor and burn it further.
And we begin, by taking the mull, which already exists, which lies in this kühlbecken or trockenbehältern at the reactor.
also is that, what for these reactors a problem war, that, what we are in our filling and thus the mull volume is dramatically reduced during this process.
But while they have talked to the various people of this world about these possibilities,
Where is the greatest interest, so was it really to implement?
bg : now we have uns not yet on a place fixed and there is a menge interesting offenlegungsregeln for everything the &quot; nuclear &quot; im name trägt . there is a great interest and the people des enterprises were in Russia , India , China ... I was here and had the energy minister met and talked about how this to the energy agenda fits .
I am optimistic. they know that the French and Japanese have done something in the direction.
This is a variant of a matter that has been made.
That’s an important step forward, but it’s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this, so everyone who has a fast reactor has a candidate for our first.
In their imagination: zeitrahmen and the likelihood of calling something like this really in life?
bg: now we need one of these scalable, power-generating things, which are very cheap, we have 20 jahre to erfinden and then 20 jahre to use.
That is almost the deadline, which has shown us the environmental model, which we have to observe.
And, they know, terrapower, if everything goes well, and that’s a great desire, it could be easy to keep.
And fortunately there are dozens of firms today, and we need hundreds of firms who, just as if their approaches work, the promotion for their pilots works, can contribute to it.
And it would be best if there were several creatures, because then one could use one mixture.
In one case, we need a solution.
With regard to the great possible breakthrough, is this the greatest that you know?
bg: an energy break is the allerwichest.
That would have been without the environmental challenge, but that power is so much more important.
In the nuclear sector there are other innovative firms.
They know, we know their work is not as good as this, but there is the modular method, that is a different approach.
There is a fluid reactortype that seems somewhat difficult, but maybe they say that it is about us.
And thus there are different, but the beautiful thing about it is that a uran molecule has a million times as much energy as one, we say, a cohlemolecule and therefore, when they can deal with the problems and they are mainly the radiation, the fußabdruck and the cost, it plays the potential, so the effects on the land and other things, fast in a own league.
If it doesn’t work, what then?
Do we need to initiate emergency measures to try to keep the earth temperature stable?
bg: if man comes into this situation, it is like if man has eaten too much, and shortly before a herzinfarkt stands. what makes man then? you may need a herzoperation or similar.
There is a research direction that calls itself geoengineering, which deals with different techniques to delay the heating, so that we will be 20 or 30 years longer to get together.
This is just a method of insurance.
They hope that we don’t need it.
Manche leute says, man should not work first on the insurance because one may faul, soass man further isst because man knows that one the herzoperation will save.
I don't know whether it's wise if you take the importance of these problems ahead of the eyes, but there's now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that to be available, if the things come faster, or this innovation takes longer than we expect.
Climate Skeptic: Do you have one or two sentences for them to persuade you?
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics live in very different camps.
Those who make scientific arguments are very few.
They say that there are negative effects that have to do with the cloud, that things are delayed?
There are very, very few things that you can say at all, of which there is a chance in a million.
The main problem here is as similar to the case with AIDS.
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it much later.
And that’s why the idea is, now, if you have all possible urgent problems, to invest in something, from which you have only later – and that’s why the investment is not so clear. in fact, the IPCC report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world who look at the IPCC and say, okay, that’s not a big drama.
The fact is that this uncertainty should make us sorge.
But my trauma here is that if you can do it economically, and at the same time you can eliminate CO2, then you say the skepticer: &quot; okay, it doesn’t interest me, that it doesn’t emite CO2, I want fast, that it doesn’t emite, but I will probably accept it, because it’s cheaper than the previous method. &quot;
And that would be their answer to the björn lomborg argument that, if you all this time and energy used to solve the CO2 problem, all the other ziele darunter suffer, the armuts reduction, the fight against malaria and so on, that it is a stupid waste of resources, money to invest, while there are better things that we can tun.
bg: now, the actual expenditure for the research — we say the U.S. should spend 10 billion per year more than they do today — that’s not so dramatic.
Darunter should not suffer other things.
One then comes to large amounts of money, and here reasonable people can contradict, if one has something that is not economic, and tries to finance it.
It is unless, man is very short before a costendurchbruch and financed only the lesson curve. i believe we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper.
falls der abstrich, den man bekommt, a very high energy price is, then can only the rich mithalten.
I mean, each of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle.
For the lower two billion but it’s a disaster.
And Lomborg itself thinks about it.
His new mask is now : &quot; why is the investigation not discussed anymore ? &quot;
er will still be, because of his previous stories, associated with them skepticer-camp, but er has understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore brings er now the research argument.
And that’s a thought that I consider angemessen.
The forschung, it’s just crazy how little it’s supported.
Bill, I believe I speak for fast all men here, if I say, I really hope that your wish will be true.
bg : thank you .
vor a few jahren , here bei ted , stellte peter skillman a design-wettbewerb names &quot; the marshmallow-threatening &quot; vor .
The idea is quite simple. vierer-teams must the greatest possible freistehende structure with 20 spaghetti, about 1m klebeband, about 1m faden and a marshmallow bauen.
The marshmallow must be on the top.
And, although it really seems simple, it’s actually really hard because it’s very quick to work together.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea and I’ve turned it into a design-workshop.
It was a risky success.
Since then I have conducted approximately 70 workshops worldwide, with students, developers and architects, even with ctos der fortune-50 companies and there is something in this task, was deep impression in the nature of collaboration enables and I want to share some of them with them.
Normally, most people begin to orient themselves regardless of the task.
She talks about it, she thinks about it, how it will look, she rangeln um power,
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization. they skizzieren and put spaghetti out.
They invest a large part of their time in the combination constantly developing structures.
And finally, just before you have no time anymore, someone takes the marshmallow and they put him behutsam on the spitze, throw a step back and &quot; ta-da &quot; ! admire her work.
was then, fast always, passert is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; to a &quot; uh-oh &quot; will be, because the weight of the marshmallows bewirkt that the whole thing verbiegt and stumbles.
There is a lot of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; -moments than others, and among the worst ones are fresh bwl-absolventen.
They lie, they shummeln, they are confused and produce truly dürftige gebilde.
And of course there are also teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; -gebilde and among the best are fresh graduates of the kindergartens .
And that’s quite surprising.
As Peter tells us, they produce not only the highest turms, but also the most interesting structures of all.
What they may be asking is: how does it come? why? what is it with them?
and peter says : &quot; keines der kinder investiert zeit darin chef der spaghetti gmbh zu sein &quot; .
They don’t invest time in power fighting.
But there is another reason.
And that the bbl-students were trained to find a right plan, ok!
And then to realize it.
What happened then when they den marshmallow on the spitze packen, they don’t have time anymore and what happened?
It is a crisis.
It sounds familiar, what?
What kindergartenkinder does different is that they start with the marshmallow and prototype build, successful prototype, always with the marshmallow an der spitze, so that they multiple times have the possibility to repair the baufällige prototype.
Constructors recognize this art of co-work as the core of an iterative prediction.
And with every attempt to get the kids immediate feedback was functioned and was not.
So is the leistung, with the prototype to work, essential - but let’s see once, how different teams act.
The average for the majority is about 50cm, bbl-students create the half of it, lawyers a little more, but not a lot, kindergarten kids are better than the adults.
Who is the most successful one?
Architect and engineer, to the luck.
1m is the highest thing I’ve seen.
And why? because they understand dreiecke and self-enforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures.
These are somewhat above the average. but here it will be interesting.
If you put an executive administrator on the team, you will be significantly better.
They see themselves and recognize &quot; this team will win. &quot;
You can predict that, why is it possible?
Because they have special abilities of the processbeacon.
She leiten the process, she understands it.
and jenes team, which regulates and care for the work, will significantly improve the performance of the teams.
Specialized skills and processing skills and their combination lead to success.
If you have 10 teams that are typically running, you get about 6 teams that have stable structures.
I’m trying something exciting.
I thought, we will bring the poker insatz the same.
Also bot I a $10,000 price an software for the winner.
What do you think you did with this design student?
Was war das ergebnis?
No team had a stable structure, no team had a stable structure.
If anybody had built a 2.5cm high construction, it would have been the price after the house getragen.
Is it also not interesting that high wetteinsats have a strong effect?
We repeat this exercise with denselben student.
What do you think it has passed now?
nun verstanden sie den vorteil des &quot; prototyping &quot; .
So became out of itself, a bad team of one among the best.
They produced the highest construction in the least time.
There are thus deep-greifende lessons for us, about the nature of antrieb and success.
Why would someone actually invest time to create a marshmallow-challenge?
der grund ist, I help digital tools and proces to create, to help teams to help, cars, video games and &quot; visual effects &quot; to create.
And what the marshmallow-challenge tut is, she helps them hidden annahmen to identify.
Every project has its own marshmallow.
The challenge provides a common experience, a common speech or basic behavior, to build the right prototype.
And this is the value of this experience, this simple exercise.
And those of them who are interested can visit marshmallowchallenge.com.
It’s a blog, where you see how you see the marshmallows baut.
There is a step-by-step guide there.
They find crazy<unk> out of all world, how people of the system optimize and refinate.
There is also a world record.
And the basal lesson, I believe, is that construction is actually a verbindender sport.
It requires that we all focus our minds on the task and that we use our thinking optimally, as our feelings and our tunes, in the challenge that lies in front of us.
And sometimes it is a small prototype of this experience all, what it needs, uns from one &quot; uh-oh &quot; - to one &quot; ta-da &quot; -moment to bring.
And that can make a big difference.
A lot of thanks.
We are as if we had a machine here.
A large machine, a cool, a ted-arty machine, and that’s a time machine.
And everyone in this room must enter.
And they can go into the past, they can go into the future; they cannot remain here and now,
And I wonder what they would choose, because I have often asked this question to my friends in latter time, and they all wanted to go into the past.
I don't know . they wanted in the time back , before it was cars gab or twitter or &quot; America sucht the superstar &quot; .
I don’t know.
I am convinced that man is somehow zur nostalgia, zu wunschdenken hingezogen.
And that I understand.
I am not a member of this group, I have to say.
I will not in the past, and that is not, because I am an adventurer.
It’s because the possibilities on this planet don’t go back, they go forward.
I will also go in this machine, and I will go in the future.
This is the greatest time, which is the time on this planet, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time, which is the time
There was no time like this.
My ur-großeltern died all when they were 60.
My grandfather pushed this number to 70.
My eltern is the 80s on the fersen.
So it should be better for a nine am anfang of my todeszahl to stand.
But it is not bad about people like us, for this is a greater thing than that.
A kind that is born today in new-delhi can wait as long to live as the richest man on the world before 100 jahren.
Think about it, that’s an incredible tatsache.
And why is that so?
The pocken have getötet billions of people on this planet.
They have the demography of the erde on a weise new geformt, as it is not a war that has been achieved.
They’re gone, they’re gone.
We have you unwungen. puff.
In the rich world there are illnesses, which millions of us before only one generation have not yet suffered, hardly yet.
diphterie , röteln , kinderlähmung ...
No one knows what this is?
Impfstoffs, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, are the success of the scientific method.
And from my sight, the scientific method is to try, see, if it works, change, if it does not do, one of the greatest errors of mankind.
This is also the good news.
Unfortunately, this is already the whole good news, because there are a few other problems, and they have been frequently mentioned,
And one of them is that despite all our errors, a billion people on this world one tag hungry to go to bed.
This number rises, and it rises very quickly, and that’s shameful.
And not only that, we have used our imagination to thoroughly destroy this world.
Drinkwater, urbares land, rainforest, beer, gas: they disappear, and it is bald, and falls we uns not out of this chaos out-innovieren we disappear too.
The question is also: can we do that? I think already.
I believe it is clear that we can produce the substance that billions of people will feed, without the land they live on, to overwhelm.
I think we can supply this world with energy that it does not destroy at the same time.
I really believe that, and no, that is no wunschdenken.
But here it keeps me waking at night—one of the things that keeps me waking at night. we have the scientific progress not even as urgently needed as now, not even,
And we were not yet in the desire to use him reasonably, as we can today.
We are an der schwelle zu erstaunlichen, erstaunlichen Ereignissen in many areas. and yet I really think that we hundreds, 300 years before the Enlightenment must go back, to find a time in which we have progressed fighting, in which we have been struggling over these things harder, an more fronts than now.
The people hole themselves in their glaubens, and so eng that they cannot be released.
Not even the truth will liberate it.
Everyone has a right to his own mind, even a right to his own mind to progress.
But do you know what you don’t have right?
They have no right to their own facts. &apos; tschuldigung, they have no right.
It took me a long time to find out.
Vor approximately one year ago I had an article about impfungen for &quot; the new yorker &quot; written, a small article.
And I was surprised, to confront resistance, to resistance against them, which is finally the most effective measure in health in the history of mankind.
I didn’t know, what I should tun, so did I just was I always kill, I wrote an article and fuhr fort.
And soon after that I wrote an article about genetically modified nutrients.
The same thing, but bigger.
The people are crazy to play.
So I also wrote an article about it, and I couldn’t understand why the people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood &quot;, why they believed that the molecule on a particular rather than a random art herumzuschieben a overgriff on the territory of nature was.
But you know, I kill what I kill. I wrote the article, I continued.
I mean, I am a journalist.
We eat, we eat, we eat, we eat, we eat, we eat, we eat, we eat.
But this article made me sorge, and I couldn’t find out why, and finally found me it out.
And that’s because these fanatics, who made me crazy, were not fanatics at all.
They were the umsichtige leute, the gebildete leute, the anständige leute.
They were just like the people in this room.
And that took me so shy...
But then I thought, they knew, we were honest:
We are an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point, an angelangt point.
We are talking about it.
We speak ironically of that, with small anführungszeichen darum : &quot; fortschritt &quot; .
Well, there are reasons for it, and I think we know what reasons they are.
We have the confidence in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in the science in itself lost, and there is no reason why it should not be so.
You can simply name a few names and the people will be understood.
tsernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , massenvernichtungswaffen , the US-presidential election 2000 .
I mean, you know, you can choose your own list.
There are questions and problems with the people, of whom we believe that they are always right.
They ask questions, they ask evidence, they ask evidence, they ask evidence.
They take nothing but given hin.
But now comes &apos;s: if they get evidence they must accept these evidence, and we are not good.
And I can say that for that reason that we are now living in an epidemic of horrors, as I have not seen them yet and hopefully will not see them again.
Vor ungefähr 12 jahren was a story published, a terrible story that the autism-epidemic with them masern, mumps, and rotteln impfstoff in verbindung brachte.
Very furchteinflößend.
Haufenweise studies were conducted in order to see, ob das stimmte.
Haufenweise studies should be carried out; that is a serious anger.
The dates come here.
Die daten kamen herein aus den usa, aus england, aus schweden, aus Canada, and they were all equal, no correlation, no verbindung, gar no.
It makes no difference because we an anecdoten glauben, we believe, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see, what we see.
We don’t believe a bundle of documents by a government agency, which gives uns daten, and I understand that, I think, that tun us all.
But do you know what?
The ergebnis of this war was disastrous,
The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world, in which the impfrate for masern sinkt.
This is scandalous and we should be ashamed.
It is horrible.
What’s happening that we could do that.
I understand that, that kills me.
Does anyone have a maser here?
Has a single im audience is someone an masern sterben see?
It does not happen very often.
It has not happened in this country at all, but 160,000 times in the world in the last year.
There are many tode through masern, 20 per hour.
But because this is not happening here, we can verdrängen, and people like Jenny McCarthy can herumlaufen and messengers of angst and analphabetism of platforms like oprah and larry king live preach.
And that can they do because they do not connect cause and correlation.
They don’t understand that these things seem to be the same, but they’re almost not the same.
And that’s something we need to learn, and it’s very fast.
This guy was a held, Jonas Salk.
He has freed us from one of the worst geisels of mankind.
No angst, no qualen, no kinderlähmung, puff, disappeared.
The guy in there is not so much.
It is called Paul Offit.
He has just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other leuten.
It can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 kindern per jahr in the developing countries.
Very good, isn’t it?
Now, that’s good, apart from the fact that Paul herumläuft and over impfstoffe speaks and says how valuable they are, and that the people should simply stop shaking.
And that said is actually so.
Paul is also a terrorist.
If Paul speaks in a public hearing, he can’t be without bewaffnete wächter.
Er gets an appeal to the house because the people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school.
And why? because Paul has made a pollutant.
I don’t need to say, but impfstoffe are unentbehrlich.
Man takes it strong, returns the diseases back, terrible diseases, and that happens just.
We now have a maser in this country.
And that will become worse, and pretty soon the children will die again, for this is just a frage of the zahlen.
And they will not only die an masern.
What is it with childhood? we take it. why not?
A comilitonin of me has me for a few weeks written and said she believes I am a bit to schrill.
No one has said that.
She would not have her child against childhood impfen. at no case.
Fein is.
Why? because we don’t have childhood. and you know what?
We did not have any children in this country last week.
Today, I don't know, maybe this morning someone stieg in lagos in a plane and flies just to the angels, in the moment is over ohio.
And in a few hours land is and rents a car, and it comes to long beach, and it will be one of these fantastic ted-dinner to visit this evening.
And you don’t know that you’re infected with a fluing disease, and we don’t know that, because this is how the world now works badly.
That is the planet on which we live. tun it not as if it is that is not.
We love it, we love it, we love it, we love it, we love it.
Did you get all your vitamins this morning?
Echinacea, a small antioxidant, gives them on the sprung hilft.
I know they’ve done that because half of the Americans do that one tag.
They take the zeug, and they take alternative remedies, and it makes no difference how often we find out that they are nutzlos.
The daten belegen das constant.
She verdunkeln her urine. more tun she fast not.
They want $28 billion for dark urine zahlen.
I totally agree with them.
Dunkler urine and dark urine.
Why do we do that? - Why do we do that?
Now, I believe, I understand - we hate the pharmaindustrie.
We have no trust in the system. we have no trust in the system.
And we should not do that either. our health system is male.
It is grausam to millionen von leuten.
It is absolutely erstaunlich kalt and seelentötend itself to us who can afford it.
So we run away, and where do we go?
We run in the weapons of the placebo industry.
I love the placebo industry.
But you know, that’s really a serious anger, because the zeug is mist, and we give a billion dollars for it out.
And I have all possible small requirements here.
No one of them -- gingko, betrug, echinacea, betrug, acai, so I don't know bad, what is, but we give a billion dollars for it out, it's betrug.
And they know what? if I do the wisdom, the people will scream to me and say, 'What is your concern?' let the people do what they want.
So you feel good. &quot;
And you know what? you are wrong.
because it doesn’t matter if it’s the health minister is, who says: &quot; hmm, I’ll be the evidence of my expert to mammography not accept &quot; or any cancer-quacksalber, who will treat his patient with coffee-einloufen.
If they go on this path, where the faith and the magic will replace the evidence and the science, they will come to a place where they do not want to be.
She's gonna get to thabo mbeki in South Africa.
er brachte 400,000 of his leute um because er on that stands that rote beete, knoblauch and zitronenol are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs, of which we know that they can remove the course of AIDS.
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in one country, which is worse than any other being plagued by this disease.
Please don’t tell me that these things have no consistency.
They always have you, they always have you.
Now, the hirnlosest epidemic, in which we are just, is this absurd struggle between the befürwortern gentechnisch veränderter nutrients and the bio-elite.
This is an idiot debate. it has to stop.
It is a debate about wörter, about metaphern.
It is ideology, not science.
Everything we eat, every reiskorn, every zweig petersilie, every rosenkohl, was changed by the men.
There was no mandarine in paradise.
There was no cantaloupe-melonen.
There was no Christmas tree, we did it all.
We have done it in the last 11,000 years.
And manches of it has worked and manches not.
We are losgeworden, what doesn’t work hat.
Now we can do it more detailed . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in reis tun , and the zeug can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives to extend .
Do you don’t want to do that?
I have to say, I don’t understand it.
We are leaving gentechnisch veränderte nahrung ab.
Why do we tun?
nun, what I constantly hear is: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don’t want a huge felder with a sache, that’s false.
We don’t want firms to live patenting.
We don’t want the companies to own together.
And you know what my answer to all that is?
You’re right, you’re right, we’re right.
It is true, we have a huge nutrition problem, but that’s not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It is right, moral, and patent.
They know that science is not a company.
It is not a land.
It is not an idea; it is a process.
She is a process, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t, but the idea that we the science should not allow her work to tun, because we fear is a real sackgasse, and she holds millions of people vom aufblühen ab.
They know, in the next 50 jahren we will 70 percent more nahrung have to grow than in the moment.
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years.
A shame, a shame.
They need it, and we don’t give it to them.
Gentechnically altered replacement.
We want the people not to ermutigen, this verrotete zeug to eat, as for the beispiel maniok.
Maniac is something that half a billion people eat.
It’s like a potato.
It’s just a bunch of calories. it’s a man.
It has no nutrients, it has no protein, and scientists are bauen all das just darin ein.
And then the people could eat it and would not be blind.
They would not die of hunger, and you know what?
It would be nice. it would not be at panisse, but it would be nice.
And all that I can say about this is: Why do we fight that?
I mean, we ask ourselves: why do we fight that?
Because we don’t want any genes herumschieben?
It is not a chemical, it is not a chemical, it is not a chemical.
It is not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our persistence to greater nahrung, better nahrung, unique nahrung.
It goes here not about rice crispies, it goes darum, people are living to get, and it will be the highest time, to understand what it means.
Do you know what?
If we don’t do it, if we do so further as before we do uns an something guilty, an dem we, glaube I, don’t want to be guilty, high-tech colonialism.
There is no other description of what happened here.
It’s selfish, it’s wicked, it’s our unworthy, and we have to really stop it.
After this incredibly fun conversation they also want to say: &quot; willst you still in this ridiculous time machine and in the future go? &quot;
In one case, I will in one case.
Im moment steckt sie in der gegenwart, but we have an incredible possibility.
We can put this time machine on everything we want.
We can move them where we want, and we will move them where we want.
We have to conduct these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go up in the time machine and go in the future, we will be happy to have done that.
I know that we can, and as far as it matters me, it is something that the world needs now.
Thank you .
Thank you .
Since one time I am interested in the placebo effect. it may seem strange that a magier is interested in it, unless they look at it as I am, as &quot; a fraud that becomes something real when someone just feels enough to believe it. &quot;
In other words, sugar pills have shown in some studies a measurable effect, the placebo effect, and that’s just because the person thinks what’s going on with her, whether it’s a pharmaceutical or a art of ... in pain management, for example, there’s, if the patient only fixed enough to believe it, a measurable effect in the body, which man calls the placebo effect.
A deception becomes something realem because someone is so realismmt.
So that we understand each other too, I want to show them now an elementary, very simple zaubertrick.
And I’m going to show them how it works. that’s a trick that has been set at least since the 1950s in every zauberbuch for children.
I myself had it from the cub scout magic of the pfadfinder in the 1970s.
I will execute it for you and then explain it.
And then I will explain why I will declare it.
Also, see what passed.
The messer, which they can investigate; my hand, which they can investigate.
I’m going to keep it just in my faust.
I take my armband back.
And in order to make sure that nothing in my arm disappears or comes out of it, I’m just going to gather my handglink right here.
On this way you can see that you are zu keiner zeit somewhat moves. solange i here zudrücke, can nothing in my arm wandern or outcome.
And the soul is very simple.
I will open my hand, and hopefully, if everything goes well, the messer will be fixed through my bloßen physical magnetism.
Es sit really so fest an his place that I can shütteln it without that the messer falls.
Nothing wandert in my arm or comes out, no trickserei. and they can investigate everything.
The Ta-da !
nun, das is a trick, den I often small kindern beibringe, who are interested in zauberei, because you can learn very much about cheating, if you see more, although it is a very simple executive trick.
Vermutlich know many of them here im saal this trick.
It works as follows:
I keep the messer in my hand.
I say that I am my handgelenk umschließe, um ensure that nothing in my arm disappears or comes out, and that’s a lie.
The reason why I keep my handgelenk is that there is the true mystery of the illusion.
In that moment, namely, where I take my hand away from them, so that they can see them from the side, this finger moves here, my zeigefinger, simply from there, where is war, in a position, in which it is so stretched.
Toller Trick?
There was someone who had no kindness.
It is here, it is here, it is here.
And when I swallow myself, the finger changes his position.
And now you can talk about why this is a fraud, why you don’t realize that here below there are only three fingers to see: because the mind and the art, as is informationen processed, they don’t count individually, one, two, three, but they see them as a group.
But it’s not going to be here now, and then I’ll open my hand.
Of course it will be held there, but not by the magnetism of my bodies, but by a trick, by my zeigefinger, which is now there.
And when I clay my hand, it happens the same, by moving back, it is hidden by this movement that the finger moves back again.
I take this hand away. and here is the messer.
You can bring this trick to your friends and neighbors. thank you.
So, what does it have to do with the placebo effect?
Before a year or so, I read a study that really has me properly umgehauen.
I am not a doctor or a researcher, and that’s why it was a surprising thing for me.
It has been revealed as follows: if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill, in the form of a aspirin tablet, it is simply a round, white pill, which has a certain measurable effect.
But if they change the form, in which they receive the placebo, for example, into a smaller pill, and characterize this blue color and a buchstaben on it, it is actually messbar more effective.
and das, although no of them any pharmazeutische ... it is bloß sugar pills .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
That really let me outflippen.
But it turned out that that’s not all yet.
If you take the capsule, they are even more effective than the tablets of any form.
A colourful capsule, which is on one end yellow and on another rot, is better than a white capsule.
The dosage also plays a role.
A pill two times a day is not as good as three pills - I can now not an exact statistics erinnern . tut me leid .
But the crucial thing is...
The dosage also plays a role.
And the form plays a role.
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect, you have to take the negative effect.
A spray with an ineffective - a couple of millilits of an ineffective substance, which is injected to a patient.
Das erzeugt a very strong picture im kopf. Das is very much stronger than a white pill.
This graph is really ... I will show them a different mistake if we have a projector.
Tatsache also is that the white pill doesn’t work as well as the blue pill, which doesn’t work as well as a capsule, which doesn’t work as well as the bad.
And none of them has any truly pharmaceutical properties. it is only our glaube to that which in us achieves a stronger effect.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick.
I take something that obviously is a fraud, and let it really look like.
We know and out of jener study that man zur nadel must greifen, if it is zur sache must go.
This is a 18 cm long hutnadel. she is very, very spitz. and I will first sterilize her a little bit.
Das hier is really my fleisch. it is not damians special gezüchtetes fleisch.
This is my top. this is not a special effect from Hollywood.
I will now stechen this nadel in my height and run through it, until it is on the other side again austritt.
falls them bad will - if they easily in ohnmacht fall - I have that a couple of friends last night in the hotel room forged, and a few people, which I didn't know, and at the same time is a woman fast becoming ohnmacht.
I also schlage vor, if you quickly get bad, then look at them for the next 30 seconds away. or, know they was, I will make the first heiklen you here.
You can see it, but you can also see it, if you want.
So, it goes so, right here, where my fleisch begins, I am underen part of my arms I will just make a small one-stick.
Does it make me crazy? - Does it make me crazy?
And now just a little bit through my top and on the other side so out again.
Now we are in the same situation as we had at the Messertrick.
About about.
But now you can’t count my finger, isn’t it?
So I will show them, that is one, two, three, four, five.
Now yes,
I know what the people think when they see it.
They say: &quot; okay, there is<unk> not so stupid and permeate himself the top, just about us a few minutes long to talk. &quot;
Now, then I will show you it.
How does it look like here? pretty good.
Yes, I know it.
And the people say: &quot; okay. I haven't seen it right. &quot;
The people in the neighborhood come now rein.
Let me show them out of the sight.
That’s really my top. that’s not a special effect from Hollywood.
This is my flesh, and I can herumdrehen.
If they get bad, look away, don’t look away.
The leute hinten or the ones that die later some time on video see, will say, &quot; nun yeah, das looks and quite impressive out, but if it would be real, it would be - see it, here is a loch and there, if it would be real, it would bluten. &quot;
Okay, let me get a little blood for you outquetschen.
Yes, here is it.
Normally, I would now take out the shortcomings.
I would clean my arm and show them that there are no wounds.
But I think, in this mercy here and with the intention of making something real from a fraud, I will just let the nadel drin and so from the stage go.
We will meet each other a few times in the next tag.
I hope you’re looking forward to it. thank you very much.
Everyone is talking about happiness today.
I have some leute that the number of books count, which mit &quot; happiness &quot; im title in the last five years were published and they gaben after approximately 40 on, and there was much more.
There is a gewaltige welle des interesses an happiness under forschern.
There is a lot of glücks-coaching.
Everyone would like to make the people happier.
But despite all this flut of work, there are several cognitive falls that make it sozusagen fast impossible, clear over happiness nachzudenken.
And my vortrag today will be mainly handled by these cognitive falls.
This applies to those who think about their own happiness, and it applies to scientists who think about happiness, because it turns out that we are exactly as hard as each other.
The first of these falls is a widerstreben, complexity to admit.
It turns out that the wort happiness is simply not a useful wort anymore because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is a certain meaning to which we could limit it, but in great and whole it is something that we must give up, and we will be the complicated visible must accept on what well-being is.
The second failure is a confusion of experience and memory: in the ground it consists between being happy in his life and being happy over his life or happy with his life.
And these are two very different concepts, and they are both gathered together in the representation of vom Glück.
And the third is the concentrations-illusion, and that’s the unfortunate attitude that we can’t think about a condition that affects well-being, without distorting its meaning.
I think this is a real cognitive failure.
There is simply no way, it’s the right way to get HIN.
Now I would like to start with a example of someone who had a frage-and-responsive-session after one of my vorlesungen, who<unk> a story. &#91; undeutlich ... &#93; he said, he had heard a symphony, and it was absolutely wonderful music, and all in the end of the recording there was a terrible creischendes geräusch.
And then added er hinzu, really quite emotional, that has all the experience ruined.
But that had not been.
What was ruined had been the memories of the experience.
He had the experience.
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music gehabt.
The memory was ruined, and the memory was all that was to be retained.
What is really said is that we think about ours and about other people can think in the mind of two species of ourselves.
There is a surviving self, who lives in the present and who knows the present, who is able to experience the past again, but in the ground only the present has.
It is the erlebende self, it is the doctor's approach -- they know, if the doctor asks: &quot; it is now pain, if I am her here anfasse? &quot;
And then there is a remembrance of itself, and the remembrance of itself is that which contains, and the history of our lives holds up, and it is the remembrance that the doctor addresses by asking the question: &quot; how have they felt in the last time? &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or so similar .
These are two very different units, the erlebende self and the erinnernde self, and the two too confusing is part of the durcheinanders of the notions of happiness.
Now, the erinnernde itself is a storyteller.
and das really starts with a fundamental response to our memories an -- it starts immediately an .
We don’t just tell stories when we make ourselves tell stories.
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we can keep by our experiences is a story.
And let them start with an example.
There is another study.
These are genuine patients who are undergoing a painful procedure.
She is nowadays no more schmerzhaft, but she was schmerzhaft, when this study was conducted in the 1990ern.
They were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain.
And here are two patients. these are their records.
And they will be asked: &quot; who of the two has suffered more? &quot;
And that’s a very simple phrase.
his darmspiegelung was longer, and every minute of pain, that patient a had had patient b, and more.
But now there’s another phrase : &quot; how much do these patients think that they’re sorry ? &quot;
Here is a surprise:
And the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse erinnrung an the darmspiegelung than the patient b.
The stories of the darm reflections were different, and because a very decisive part of history is how it ends,
And none of these stories is very erbaulich or great — but one of them is this clearly ...
But one of them is significantly worse than the other.
And the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse was the worse.
How do we know that?
Because we have asked these people for their darmspiegelung, and also much later: &quot; how bad was the whole matter in total? &quot;,
And she was much worse for a than for b in the erinnrung.
Now, that is a direct conflict between the surviving self and the remembering self.
Out of the sight of the survivor himself had b clearly a worse time.
nun, what man with a patient could do, and we have actually conducted clinical experiments, and it is done, and it works, man could actually the darmspiegelung of a patient a prolonged by man simply the schlauch drin leaves without too much an him to rütteln.
This will cause the patient to suffer, but only a little and much less than before.
And if you have done that a few minutes long power you have done that the survival of the patient itself is a worse and you have done that the survival of the patient itself is a much better thing, because now you have done that the patient itself is a better story about your experience.
What does a story draw up?
And this applies to the stories that the memory brings to us, and this applies to the stories that we inherit.
Through which a history is marked are umbrüche, significant augenblicke and end.
The ends are very, very important and in this case dominated the end.
Now, the erlebende himself lives his life continuously.
Es hat augenblicke des erlebens, one after the other.
And you ask: what has happened with this moment?
And the answer is really simple. they are lost forever.
I mean, the majority of the eyes of our lives -- and I have the ausgerechnet -- they know that the psychological present is considered as approximately three seconds long. what means, they know that in a life there are approximately 600 million of them. in a month there are approximately 600,000.
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory of themselves.
And yet they get somehow the impression that they should count that was during this augenblicke des erlebens passert our life is.
It is the limited resource that we consume while we are on this world.
And how we use them would seem to be important, but that’s not the history that the memory itself retains for us.
So we have the erinnernde ourselves and the erlebende ourselves, and they are really quite different.
The greatest difference between them is the time.
If you have a holiday and the second week is exactly as good as the first, then the two-week holiday is twice as good as the one-week holiday.
This does not work for the erinnernde itself.
For the erinnernde itself, a two-week holiday is hardly better than the one-week holiday, because there are no new memories to be added.
They have not changed the history.
And on this way, time is actually the critical variable, which a memory itself is distinguished from a surviving itself. time has very little influence on this history.
Now, the erinnernde itself makes more than to remember and tell stories.
In fact, it is the decision that matters, because if you have a patient who, we say, had two bowel reflections at two different surgeons and decides which one to choose, then it is the one who chooses the one who has the memory that is less bad and that is the surgeon who will be chosen.
The erlebende himself has no stimulus in this wahl.
In fact, we choose not between erlebnissen. we choose between erinnerungen an erlebnisse.
And even if we think of the future, we normally don’t think of our future as experiences.
We think of our future after as predisposed memories.
And in the ground they can see it, they know it, as a tyrannia of the remembering self, and they can think the remembering self as one, the so-called the surviving self shleppt through experiences that the surviving self does not need.
I have the impression that if we urlaub do that very often der fall is, that is, we do urlaub weitestgehend im service des erinnernden selbst.
And that’s a bit difficult to justify, I think.
I mean, how much do we distract from our memories?
This is one of the statements that are given for the dominance of the memory itself.
And if I think about it, I think of a holiday, which we have done a few years in the Antarctica, which clearly was the best holiday, which I had had, and I think relatively often of it in relation to how often I think of another holiday.
And I have probably from my memories to this three-week journey, I would say about 25 minutes long in the last four years gezehrt.
Now, if I was the ordner geöffnet had had with the 600 imagesn darin I would have spent another hour.
Now, these are three weeks, and these are a maximum of an hour and a half.
There seems to be an unrighteousness.
Now, I may be a bit extreme, know them, darin, how little appetit I have on the die of memories, but even, if they make more of it there is a real frage. why do we give memories so much weight im verlgeich to them weight, that we give erlebnissen?
I want you to think about an experiment.
They put themselves in their next urlaub vor, they know that am ende des urlaubs all their pictures will be destroyed and they get an amnesty medication, so that they will not remember anything.
Would you choose the same holiday?
And if they would choose another holiday, there is a conflict between their two kinds of des themselves and they have to think about how they decide this conflict and that is really not obvious at all, because if they think in the mind of time they get an answer. and if they think in the mind of memories they could get another answer.
Why we urlaube aussuchen, which we aussuchen, is a problem that we face with a wahl between the two kinds of ourselves.
Now, the two species of themselves throw two concepts of happiness up.
There are actually two concepts of vom glück, which we can use, one for ourselves.
You can also ask: how happy is the survivor himself?
And then they would ask, how happy are the eyes in the life of the survivors themselves?
And they’re all -- happiness for the eye is a rather complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be mixed?
And, on the other hand, we are now able to get a pretty good idea of vom glück des erlebenden themselves over the time.
If you ask the question after the glück des souvenirs, it’s a completely different thing.
It doesn’t matter how happy a person lives.
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about his life.
very different concepts.
Everyone who does not distinguish these concepts will be the erarchung des glücks vermasseln, and I belong to a menge of forschern over well-being, who have the erarchung des glücks long vermasseln on exactly this art.
The difference between the happiness of the surviving self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in the last years, and now one tries to measure the two separately.
The gallup organization has a worldwide survey, where more than half a million people are asked questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences. and there were other efforts in the direction.
In the last years we have also begun to learn about the happiness of the two species of ourselves.
And the main lesson that we, I believe, have learned is that they are really different.
They can know how satisfied someone is with his life, and that teaches her really not much about how happy is his life lives and vice versa.
In order to give them an impression of the correlation, the correlation is approximately .5 .
What that means is that if they would meet someone and a man would tell them, oh, his father is a two-meter-man, how much would they know about his size?
Now, they would know something about its size, but there is a lot of uncertainty.
They have so much uncertainty.
If I tell them that someone lives as eight on a scale of ten eingeordnet has they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his surviving himself.
The correlation is also small.
We know something about what the satisfaction of the glücks-self determines.
We know that money is very important, and ziele is very important.
We know that happiness mainly means to be satisfied with the people we like, time to spend with the people we like.
There are other disturbances, but that is dominant.
If they also want to maximize the happiness of the two kinds of themselves, they will have very different things to do.
The schlussfolgerung out of them, what I’ve said here is that we don’t really should imagine a happiness as a replacement for well-being.
This is a completely different concept.
Now, very short, another reason, from which we can’t think clearly about happiness is that we don’t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live.
If you ask the simple question, how happy the people in California are, you won’t get the right answer.
When they ask these questions they think that the people in California must be happier when they, say we, live in Ohio.
And what happened is that if you think about living in California, you think about the difference between California and other orten, and this difference exists, we say, in the climate.
Now, it turns out that the climate is not very important for the erlebende itself, and it is not even very important for the nachtenkliche itself, which decides how happy people are.
But, because the thought itself is responsible, they can am end—some people can am end go to California.
And it’s sozusagen interesting to persecute, what’s passed with people who go to California ziehen in der Hoffnung, to be happier.
Now, your survivors themselves will not be happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen. they will think that they are happier, because when they think about it they will be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was. and they will feel that they have made the right decision.
It is very difficult, clear over well-being nachzudenken, and I hope I have given you an impression of how difficult it is.
Thank you .
Thank you, I have a frage to you.
A lot of thanks.
Now, if we had a couple of weeks phoneed have mentioned them to me that it was a pretty interesting ergebnis gab, that out of this gallup umfrage kam.
Is it something that you can let us share, because you have a few minutes left now?
Daniel Kahneman: I am sure.
I think, the most interesting ergebnis, which we found in the gallup survey, is a zahl, which we absolutely do not expect to find.
We find that in the sight of the happiness of the survivors themselves.
When we look at ourselves, how the feelings come with them vary.
And it turns out that under a income of $60,000 in the year, for the Americans, and that is a very large stichprobe of the Americans, about 600,000, but it is a large representative stichprobe, under a income of $600,000 in the year.
60,000 .
dk: 60,000 .
$60,000 in the year are the people unhappy, and they become increasingly unhappy, the weaker they become.
We get an absolute flache line about it.
I say, I have rarely seen such flache lines.
was passert, it is obvious that money a no erlebnis-luck takes, but that lack of money a certain elend takes, and we can measure this elend very, very clearly.
In the mind of others themselves, in the memory of themselves, they get a different story.
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
This does not apply to emotions.
But Danny, in all American bestreben goes is um life, freedom, and the struggle for happiness.
If people would take this befund seriously, I mean, it seems to put everything on the kopf, everything, what we believe, for example in regard to steuerpolitics and so on.
Is there a chance that a politician that the country generally would take a befund like it seriously and based on it would make politics?
dk: you know, I believe, that there is recognition for the role of happiness research in politics.
The recognition will be slowly in the united states, no frage, but in the united kingdom it passes just and in other countries it passes just.
The people are in the process of acknowledging that they should think of happiness when they think of politics.
It will take a long time, and the people will discuss whether they want to erlebnis-glück erforschen or whether they want to erforschen life-evaluation, so we have to lead this discussion quite soon.
How man glück steigern can go very differently depending on how they think and whether they think an erinnernde themselves or whether they think an erlebende themselves.
That will influence politics, I think, in the coming jahren.
In the united states, it is strict to measure the happiness of the population.
That will be, I think, in the next one or two decades part of the national statistics.
Now, it seems to me, this topic will be, or should at least the most interesting political debate to be followed over the next few years.
Thank you very much for the invention of the behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I am Jane McGonigal, I am Jane McGonigal.
I develop now since 10 jahren online games. and my ziel for the next jahrzehnt is, it is just as easy to make the world in the reality to save, as it is in online games to save.
I want to convince more people, including them all, to spend more time playing with them greater and more tolerant games.
Currently we spend 3 billion hours per week with online games.
Some of them might think: &quot; this is a whole time for games. &quot;
Maybe a little too much time if you consider how many problems we dringend in the real world to have to solve.
In fact, however, my research is the institut for the future zufolge, is precisely the gegenteil zutreffend.
Three billion hours per week are not approximately enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world.
In fact, I am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we must drastically increase this time.
I have calculated that the time needed at 21 billion hours of play time per week lies.
If we want to solve problems such as hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts and fettleibigkeit, we must try to play online for at least 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next jahrzehnts to play.
No, I mean it’s really serious.
This picture describes quite accurately why I believe that games are so essential for the survival of human species in the future.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano.
He wanted to capture the feeling when playing. so has er vor den spielern built a camera.
This is one of the classic expressions when playing.
If you’re not a player, you may miss some of the nuances in this picture.
You probably see this feeling of urgency, some fear, but also extreme concentration, very deep in the solution of a really difficult problem.
If you also play, you see some nuances here, which are up to the gezogenic eyes and that can be a sign of optimism.
This is a player who is on a date of a so-called epic Sieges stands.
Oh, you know das. ok. prima. so we have a few players here.
A epischer sieg is an ergebnis that is so extremely positive that they didn’t know before that it was possible at all.
It was a beinah jenseits of the imagination.
And when they reach it, they’re shocked that they’re actually too capable of something like that.
These players stand short in front of an epic Sieg.
And this is, what we must see on millionen gesichtern of problemlösern throughout the world, when we take the hürden of the next centuries in attack. the face derer, the entgegen aller widrigkeiten am rande of an epic sieges standing.
Well, unfortunately we are more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems.
I'm really my face, I'm really my face, I'm really my face, I'm really my face, I'm really my face.
As I do &quot; in life bin I bad &quot; -face make.
This is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley, California, where I in my doctoral study studied why we in play are better than in real life.
This is a problem that many players have.
We think that in reality we are not as good as in playing.
And I mean not only less successful, although that belongs to it.
I mean good in connection with the motivation, something meaningful to tun, inspired to work together with each other.
If we are in a game world, I believe that many of us are transformed into our best version, at any time and immediately are helpful, hardly trying to solve the problem, for as long as necessary, it is after them fehlschlag again trying.
And in reality, when we fail, when we face obstacles, we often feel different.
We feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel we feel
These feelings we have not, when we play, when we play, when we play, there are they just don’t.
And that’s what I wanted to investigate as a doctor.
Why is it impossible to play, to think, you could not simply<unk> everything?
How can we transfer this feeling from the play to the reality?
Also look at my games like World of Warcraft an, which offers the ideal environment to the community problemless.
And I’ve found a few things that make the epic siege in online-welten as possible.
So, first, if you go into one of these online games, especially in the world of warcraft, there is a mix of different characters who are ready to give them a weltrettende mission anzuvertrue, and that is immediately.
But not just any mission, but a mission that fits perfectly to its current level in the game, right?
You can do that too.
You never get a task that you can’t solve.
But always am rand of their skills, so they have to strive. but there is no unemployment in the world of warcraft.
manzt not sit herum and dreht däumchen. there is always quite targeted something important to tun.
There are a lot of collaborators.
Wherever they go, hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to complete their epic mission.
That we have im wahren life is not so easy, this feeling that with a finger snipsen haufenweise collaborators are ready.
In addition, there is this epic story, this inspiring story, why we are there and what we have to do.
Then we get all this positive feedback.
They have determined von &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; belong or &quot; + 1 intelligence &quot; .
This constant feedback there is not in true life.
If I leave this stage, I don’t have: + 1 talk and + 1 crazy idea, + 20 crazy idea.
I don’t get this feedback.
Also, the problem of the co-operations-online-welten such as the world of warcraft is that it is so befriedigend, at any time am a date of an epic Sieges to stand, that we prefer to spend our whole time in these gameswelten.
They are just better than the reality.
Until today, all of the world of warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth.
This is not necessarily something bad.
It may sound bad.
But it’s bad in the context to see: before 5.93 million jahren began our first primatenvorks to go up.
The first opened primat as well.
Ok, so if we talk about how much time we currently spend with playing, it makes it only sinn, when you take the time in view of the greater order of human development in front of the eyes, what is extraordinary.
But it is also appropriate. because it turns out that by using this whole time on to play, we actually change what we as humans are in the low.
We develop ourselves to communally think, herzlichen wesen.
This is the truth, I believe in it.
Take a look at these interesting statistics, which were recently published by a carnegie mellon university researcher: the average young man of today in a country with a stronger gaming culture spends 10,000 hours with online gaming until the 21st lifetime.
Also, 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting zahl, from 2 reasons:
first time, for children in the U.S. are 10.080 hours the exact total time they spend in the school, from the 5th grade to the completion of the high school - if you never miss.
Also we have here a complete parallelbildungsweg, on which young men exactly learn what it means to be a good player, like everything else, what they learn in the school.
And maybe some of them have the new buch of malcolm gladwell, &quot; overflieger &quot;, read.
He also knows his theory of success, the theory of success of the 10,000 hours.
It is based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with them to study any subject until the 21st lifetime, we will be to master in it.
We will be as good there, whatever it is to do, as the most meaningful men of the world.
Also, what we have here, is a complete generation of junger men who are master-player.
The big frage is also : &quot; worin exactly are players meisterhaft good ? &quot;
For if we were able to find out that, we would have almost never had the human potential available before.
So many people we currently have in the world who spend at least an hour per tag with online games.
This is our master-player . 500 millionen men , who are exceptional good in &quot; something &quot; are .
And in the next decade we have another billion players who are exceptionally good in whatever are.
If you haven’t heard it yet,
The game industry has developed a console that saves energy and works on mobilefunknetzen, instead of the broadband internet, so that players around the world, especially in India, China, Brazil, can play online.
You will expect an additional billion players in the next decade.
We have a total of 1.5 billion players.
So I have begun to think about what it is, what we can do these games to master.
Here are the four things I fand. as first: dringlichkeits-optimism.
Well, imagine yourself like extreme self-motivation vor.
Dringlichkeits-optimism is the desire, immediately something to tun, a hürde to master, together with them believe that we have a reasoned hope of success.
Players always believe that an epic victory is possible, and that it’s always worth trying, and it’s the same.
Players sitzen not herum.
Players are meister im spinnen dicter social netze.
There are a lot of interesting studies that show that we can get more after we have played with them, even if they have defeated us badly.
The reason for this is that it is a mix of confidence requires to play a game with someone.
We trust that someone will spend time with us, that the rules will be followed, that we will have the same soul, and that we will remain there until the game.
It also enables the gathering of the growth of bonds, confidence and mutuality.
As a result, we build stronger social relationships.
Happy productivity. fantastic!
They know, there is a reason why the durchschnitts-word of warcraft-player 22 hours per week plays, sozusagen as part-timejob.
The reason is that when we play, we are actually happier to work hard than when we relax or do nothing.
We know that we as human beings function optimally when we do heart, meaningful work.
And players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task.
And ultimately, epic meaning.
Players love it, share ehrfurcht gebietender missions planetarer to become ausmaße.
here a background information , um das ins rechte licht zu rücken . they know<unk> all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
The second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 entries, is the World of Warcraft wiki.
Five million people use it for one month.
They have more informationen about the world of warcraft in the internet aggregated than about any other topic in any other wiki in the world.
They create an epic story.
They create an epic quelle des connaissances about the world of warcraft.
OK, there are also four superpowers that lead to a single ergebnis. players are super-powerful, hopeful individuals.
There are people who believe that they as individuals can change the world.
And the only problem is that they believe, they can change the virtual welten, but not the real.
That’s the problem I’m trying to solve.
Edward Castronova is a folk scientist.
His work is great. is investigated why people spend so much time, energy and money in the online world.
and is said : &quot; we will be witnessing not less than a mass emigration in virtual welten and online-playing. &quot;
It’s an economist, so it’s logical.
And he said...
Not like me... I’m developing games, I’m somewhat overwhelmed.
Also, it is said that it actually causes the mind, because players can reach more in online world than in real life.
They can in play stronger social bonds knüpfen than im real life. they get more feedback and rewards in play than im real life.
Also, it is said, it is currently completely logical that the player spends more time in the virtual world than in the real spending.
I agree wrong, that’s logical.
But it is definitely not an optimum situation.
We have to start transforming the real world into a game.
My inspiration comes from an ereignis, which lasts 2,500 years.
There is this ancient Würfel , aus schafsknöcheln . you know ?
vor this fantastic playelecontrollern gab es schafsknöchel .
And these were the first gaming devices developed by humans.
And if you are familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historians Herodotus, you may know this story. the story about how and why games were invented.
The sea herodotus was spile, genauer würfelspiele, im königreich lydien during a hungersnot invented.
angeblich gab es a solch big hungersnot that the king of lydien becomes a crazy idea entschloss.
The men are fighting, the men are fighting.
It was an extreme situation. man needed an extreme solution.
also erfanden sie , sea herodotus , the Würfelspiel and vereinbarten a national strategy . an one tag would man eat . am next tag would man play .
And they would be so much in the Würfelspiel verdieft, because the games are so fascinating and we are surrounded by more satisfying, more productive, that they would forget that there was nothing to eat.
And then, am next tag would you play. and am next tag would you eat.
And the sea of Herodotus survived them so 18 years long this hungersnot, by eating them a tag and playing them next.
I think, I think, we’re putting the game one today.
We set the games one to escape them leiden der realen welt.
We set the game one, to all to escape, that in the real world does not work, all that in the real life does not satisfy, and we holen uns was we need out of the game.
But that doesn’t have to be the end.
That’s the exciting.
laut herodotus became after 18 jahren the hungersnot not better. also beschloss der König, a letztes Würfelspiel to establish.
They divided the kingdom into two halves.
They played a wreck game and the winners darkened to an epic adventure to break up.
They left the Lydia and went on to seek a new home; they left just so many people back, as it was food to survive, and sucked with them rest after a gend in which they could prosper.
It sounds crazy, right?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the etrusker, which later the Roman rich bildeten, has the same DNA as the old lydier.
Therefore kamen scientists recently zur auffassung that Herodotus &apos; verrückte history actually stimmt.
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling, which lasted almost 20 years, what the hunger could explain.
It could also stimulate this mad story.
Per<unk> they have actually saved their people by playing, by fleeing 18 years in games, and then they have had these intrusions and learned so much about playing with each other, that they have saved the whole civilization.
So, we can do that too.
We have been playing Warcraft since 1994.
Das war das erste strategiespiel in echtzeit der world of warcraft-serie. Das war vor 16 jahren.
They played 18 jahre lang würfelspiele, we played since 16 jahren warcraft.
I behaupte, we are ready for our own epic games.
So, they send half of their civilization to the souche for a new world. so I take my 21 billion play hours per week.
We should agree that half of us spend an hour per tag with playing until we have solved the problems of the real world.
I know, they will be questions: &quot; how do we solve the problems of the real world in playing? &quot; and exactly this question I have my work in the last years I am the institut for the future gewidmet.
We have this banner in our office in palo alto, it is drückt out how we should understand the future.
We don’t want to try to say that future in advance.
What we want is to create the future.
We want to imagine ourselves the best possible ergebnis, and then enable men to implement this imagination into the reality.
We put an epic siege in front and give people the possibilities to<unk> them.
I show them very briefly three games that I have designed to try to provide human epic siege in their own future.
Das hier ist &quot; welt without öl . &quot;
The game is from 2007.
It is an online game in which you have to overcome a country.
The countrynappheit is invented, but we have plenty of online content so that it will be realistic for them and they live their real life actually without the death life. also, if they sign up for the game, they say uns, where they live. and then they get news-films in real time, which show them how much the death cost, what is not there, how the nutrition is deteriorated, how the transport will be deteriorated, if the schools are closed, if there are rebellions. and they have to find out how they make their real life, if it would be true. and we will ask them to blog about it, videos or photos to install.
We have tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 and we have followed them since then over the last three years.
And I can tell you, it was a changing experience.
No one wants to change his life because it is good for the environment or because we should.
But if they are in an epic adventure and said to get: &quot; uns goes the oil out. &quot;
This is a fascinating adventure, on which man goes.
Most of our players have the im game learned habits beibehalten.
So we’ve got ourselves for the next weltrettende game a greater, higher ziel gestated than just landnappheit.
We have the game &quot; superstruct &quot; am institut for the future developed .
It is based on the calculation of a supercomputer that the human beings have only 23 years on that planet.
This supercomputer is called &quot; globales aussterbungs- sensibilisierungs-system &quot; , of course .
The opruf an player , to be registered , we have fast as a &quot; Jerry-Bruckheimer &quot; -film designed .
They know Jerry Bruckheimer-film, where it is the dream team, where it is the astronaut, where it is the scientist, where it is the ex-sträfling and only together they can save the world.
But in our game, instead of just 5 people, we say, everyone is in the dream team, and it is our task to create the future for energy, nutrition, health, safety and the future of social justice.
8,000 players played the game 8 weeks long.
She finds 500 incredible creative solutions that she can nachlesen when she &quot; superstruct &quot; googlen.
and the last game brings us to the 3rd March out. it is a game in collaboration with the world bank.
If they do the game to complete, they will be awarded by the world bank the award &quot; social umgestalter &quot;, the 2010 abschluss.
We work with universities in all over Africa and invite them to participate in social reforms to learn.
We have a comic about it. we have &quot; level high &quot; for regional understanding, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and insufficiency.
I would like to invite them all to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, especially in developing areas, who benefit from it, to present together their own social enterprises to save the world.
I am coming to the end.
I want to ask her a question.
What, you believe, passed the next?
We have all these fantastic players, we have games that show us what we can tun, but we have the real world yet not saved.
Yes, I hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life, and that games have a great meaning for change.
We have these whole superpowers, happy productivity, the ability, enge social networks to knüpfen, dringlichkeits-optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
I really hope that we will play together significant games to survive another century on this planet.
I hope you’ll be playing and playing with me like this.
If I ins the next jahrzehnt vorausschaue, I am sure of two things: that we can create any imaginable future, and that we can play all possible games.
Also say I, let the world-changing games begin!
Thank you very much.
I would like to tell them something, what I noticed a few months ago when writing an article for Italian wired.
I always have my synonym-wörterbuch griffbereit when I write, but I was with them bearbeiten des textes already fertig, and me fiel up that I have not yet in my life followed, what das wort &quot; behindert &quot; really means.
I’m reading the record for you.
&quot; behindert &quot; , adjective : &quot; verkrüppelt , hilflos , nutzlos , zerstört , abgestorben , verstümmelt , verwundet , zugerichtet , lahm , abgetrennt verwahrlost , ausgedient , geschwächt , impotent , kastriert , gelähmt , gehandicapt senil , altersschwach , aus dem traffic gezogen , nachgebessert , erledigt , kaputt geborsten , selected , siehe also verletzt , nutzlos und schwach .
antonyme : gesund , strong , leistungsfähig . &quot;
I had this list of a friend sea vorgelesen and had to firstly laugh, it seemed so ridiculous, but I kam only bis &quot; zugerichtet &quot; and couldn't talk further, and I had to stop reading and I firstly gather after this overfallartigen wortflut and them associated emotional shock.
Of course, it was a exhaust, altes synonym-wörterbuch. I have just thought that the exhaust must already be quite alt.
But in fact it was an exit on the early 80s, when I just started with the primary school and thus started, my self-image outside my family environments to build up and to form, also in relation to other children and to the rest of the world um me herum.
Thank you very much, I don’t use a synonymous dictionary.
If I would take this post seriously, I would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives can be in no way positive, but today I will be celebrated for the opportunities and adventures I have experienced.
also have I immediately contacted the online edition of 2009 and expect that I find an ansprechender contribution here.
Here is the updated version of this post.
Dummerweise, she is not much better.
especially erschüttern me the last two wörter under &quot; near antonyms &quot; &quot; ganz &quot; and &quot; gesund &quot; .
But it’s not just about the wörter.
It’s about what we think about the people we describe with these words.
It’s about the values that stecken in these words, and how we build these values.
Our speech affects our thought and how we see the world and the men um uns herum.
Many ancient societies, including the Greek and the Romanian, have truly believed that the pronunciation of a fluch has a great power, because that, what man loudly speaks, can also manifest itself.
So, what do we really want to manifest – a disabled man or a powerful man?
It could be enough for a human being to be regardless as a child, to limit them, and to overtake their imaginations.
Wouldn’t it be better to open them?
a man, who for me türen geöffnet hat, was my kinderarzt am a.i. dupont institut in wilmington in delaware.
Dr. pizzutillo is a Italian-American, whose name, as they can think, the majority of Americans could not correctly pronounce.
and dr. p. trug always very bunte fliegen and war for the work with kindern just as created .
I found the time I spent in this hospital, just toll – except for my physiotherapy.
I had to separate exercises seem unendlich often repeated with these dicken, elastic bands -- in different colors -- that you know, um my bein-muskeln to build up . and I have these bands more gehasst than anything else . i have them gehasst . i have them verflucht . i have them gehasst . i have them gehasst .
I have even already been as a five-year-old child with Dr. P. negotiated and so tried to stop these exercises, naturally without success.
and one tag has me observed at one of my exercises — these exercises were simply ermüdend and gnadenlos — and he said to me, &quot; wow, aimee, you are so a strong, powerful and junges girl, you will be a tag of one of these bands break down.
And if you get it, I give you a hundred dollars. &quot;
That was, of course, just a simple trick by Dr. P. so that I would do the exercises that I didn’t want to do, with the awareness that a rich five-year-old girl in the hospital station in the second stock would become. but it actually brought me to see my daily exercise-horror with new eyes. so it became a new and promising experience.
And I wonder today, how much his vision of me as strong and powerful junges girls my self-image has geformt and I could so imagine myself as one of nature out of strong, powerful and athletic men.
That is just an example of many, how adults in powerpositions can stimulate the imagination of a kind.
But as the already cited<unk> from the synonymous-wörterbüchern prove, our speech leaves us no room to present something that we would all wish: it is to enable each individual to see himself as a powerful man.
Our speech hints the social changes behind, which in many cases have been triggered by a technological change.
From the medical point of view from consideration, one can naturally say that my legs, the laser-chirurgy for sehobactions, the titanium knee lenses and the artificial hyperthyroid lenses for alternate bodies, which it allows humans to really use all their possibilities and develop beyond the boundaries that their natural fate has put on them, not to speak of social networking platforms, humans allow themselves to give their own identity, define themselves by their own art and weise, and thus worldwide to group orientation, which they choose themselves.
Per<unk> this technological change is clearer than it is that there has always been another truth, that every man can give something very special and very powerful to society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest plus.
The human ability to adjust - that's an interesting story, because people ask me again and again to tell me how I'm surrounding with widrigities and I'm going to give them something: this phrase has not suited for me and I've always felt very unpleasant with it, that questions of people to answer, and I believe, gradually I understand why.
This satz vom umgang mit widrigkeiten lebt von der Idee, that success or happiness depends on it, a challenge to master, without being characterized by them associated experiences. as if my life would have been so successful, because I could avoid the possible fall of a living with a prothesis, or as any human beings perceive me with my obstacle.
But the truth is that we change ourselves. of course we are characterized by the challenge, whether it is physical, emotional or even both.
And I assume that this is good.
Widrigities are no obstacles that we need to circumvent in order to get better clear with our lives.
Widrigity belongs simply to our lives.
And I deny to see widrities as my treasure.
Sometimes I notice that er is very present, sometimes is hard to see, but er is constantly with me.
And I will in no way herabset the impact or the severe of a man’s struggle.
There are in life widrigities and challenges, and they are only allzu real and every person goes differently. but the question is not whether we come clear with widrigities or not, but how we come clear with it.
So we are not only responsible for preserving those people we love from fate, but also for preparing them to be clear.
And we give our kindern no pleasure when we give them the feeling that they can’t adapt.
Two things must be clearly trained: on the one, the medical tatsache to be amputed, and on the other, the social opinion about whether or not I am behind or not.
And to be honest, the only real and persistent obstacle with which I had to stand up is that the world constantly thinks that it can describe me with these definitions.
In our desire to protect the people who are in our hearts and let them know the cold, heart truth about their medical forecast or even put a forecast to the quality of life that they expect, we must be careful that we do not put the foundation to ensure that someone is actually disabled.
Per<unk> the momentan concept, which only takes attention to what is in a caput, and how we repair, is for each individual a greater obstacle than the pathology itself.
If we do not treat a man holistically, and do not perceive and recognize all his powers and possibilities, we will create, in addition to the natural struggle they may have to lead, another disease.
We degrade a man who has a value for our society.
So we need to look beyond the pathology and focus on all the range of human possibilities.
Amwichtigste, however, is that there is a connection between the perception of our imperfections and our great erfindergeist.
We should not underestimate or deny these challenging times, we should not try to avoid them, nor should we turn them under the teppich, but it goes darum, in the widrigities opportunities to recognize.
It may be rather to me to make it clear that we don’t necessarily have to overcome widrigities, but that we are open to it, they are to the umarmen, they are able to pack to use a fight-outpress, and<unk> even to dance with it.
And maybe we create it, widrigities as something natural, stimmiges and useful to see and feel ourselves so through their presence no longer so burdened.
In this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin and as er vor 150 jahren over evolution written hat, hat Darwin, in my eyes, on something very wahres in the human character pointed out.
I would write it in this way: not the strongest of his art survived, and not the intelligentest of his art, but the one who can best adapt to change.
Out of conflict creates creativity.
Not only from Darwin’s work we know that the ability of man to survive and rise up, from the struggle of the human spirits, is determined to walk through conflicts.
Also, again, wandel and adaptation are the greatest abilities of the human.
And maybe we know only, from which holz we are scratched, when we are truly scratched.
Per<unk> it is precisely that the mind of widrigities, a perception of the ichs, a sense of our own power.
We can give ourselves something like that.
We can give widrigities a new meaning that goes beyond heavy times.
We may see widrigities as a change.
Widgets are for a change that we have not yet adapted to.
I believe, the greatest harm we have suffered to ourselves, is to believe that we should be normal.
Mal ehrlich – who is normal?
There is no normal.
There is the usual. the typical. but not the normal. and would they really want to know this army, the gray person, if it is they really would?
I think, rather not.
It would be great if we could exchange this thought pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or strength, in order to formulate it even a little more dangerous, so we can freeze the forces of very many kindern, and invite them to incorporate their very special and valuable abilities into society.
Anthropologists have found out that we human from the member of our society have always demanded one thing: to be useful and to make a contribution.
There is evidence that the Neanderthals have already carried with them 60,000 years old people and people with severe physical injury, and this may have happened because the life experience in the survival struggle of these people was valuable for society:
They have not regarded these men as corrupt and nutzless; they have been treated as something special and valuable.
For a couple of years I went in the city, in which I rose up war, in a food market in jener &quot; red zone &quot; in the north-eastern of Pennsylvania, and I stand there in front of a shuffle of tomatoes.
It was summer and I had shorts an.
And I hear, as a guy behind me says, &quot; to if you don't have aimee mullins is. &quot;
And I dreh myself and see this older man. I had no idea who he is.
And I mean &quot; apologization, sir, we know us? I can't me an sie erinnern. &quot;
And he said, &quot; now yeah, they may hardly remember me.
When I saw her for the first time, I got her out of the bauch of her mother. &quot;
Oh, also there.
And, of course, it has been made by a click.
Das war dr. kean, a man, den i nur aus stories of my mother over this tag kannte, because I naturally, very typically, to my birthday two weeks to late kam.
Der arzt für pränatale diagnostik meiner mutter war im urlaub, and so know my eltern den mann, der mich zur Welt brachte, not at all.
And because I was born without wadenbeine, and my mouths had been directed to them, and I had only a few zehen on this and a few zehen on the other fuß was er der overbringer, this stranger had to overbringe the bad news.
I had to say to your grandfather that you<unk>’t walk, and you<unk>’t be as moving as other children, or that you<unk>’t be able to live an independent life, and since then they have just lie to me.
Really extraordinary I found that er zeitungsausschnitte all my kindheit gathered hat, no matter if I had won at a buchstabier-wettbewerb in the second class, no matter if I had my scholarship or one of my sports siege errungen, and no matter if I used this ausschnitte to teach his students, medical-student from the hahnemann medical school and the hershey medical school.
and is called this part seines courses the x factor, the potential of the human will.
It is simply not enough to emphasize how crucial this factor can be for a person’s quality of life.
And Dr. Kean continued to say, he said: &quot; I have learned that children, if they don't constantly get something else said, and even if they only get a bit of support, if you leave children themselves, then children can<unk> a lot. &quot;
Dr. Kean has changed his mind.
He had understood that the medical diagnosis, and how someone deals with it, are two different things.
If they had asked me in the alter of 15 years, whether I would have changed my prothesen against beine from fleisch and knochen, then I would have not hesitated for a second.
I wanted damals necessarily to function normal.
If you ask me today, I’m not so sure.
And that’s happening because I’ve experienced something with my legs and not despite these experiences.
And<unk> this walk could also happen, because I begegnet so many people who have opened me, instead of encountering people who restrict me or want to overtake me an imagination.
See you, it really needs only one man who demonstrates to them how they can manifest their forces, and they are through.
If they allow someone to activate their own, inner forces – the human mind is so receptive – if they can, and for someone in a decisive moment they open a kind of way, then they are a very good teacher for these people.
They bring them to open themselves, to open themselves.
The real meaning of des worts &quot; educate &quot; wurzelt in dem wort &quot; educe &quot; .
It means something to highlight that in one is the potential herauszukitzeln.
Question: What potential do we want to explore?
in the 60s jahren was in the UK a fall study carried out . damals were gymnasien in wholeschulen umgewandelt .
sie nennen das dort &quot; streaming trials &quot; in den usa bezeichnen wir das als &quot; tracking &quot; .
The students are dismissed after notes.
And the a scholar will be oral harder tested, get the better teacher, etc.
They then had over a dreimonatigen zeitraum schülern with a &quot; ausreichend &quot; the note &quot; very good &quot; given . it was told them, they were asse that they were very wise . and after these three months they have really been written .
And, of course, zerbricht is one that hears to hear that umgekehrt den einser-schülern was said, they are only sufficient.
And that was the same after the three months.
But only those who were still in the school – except for the schülern, who had the school shattered.
It was very crucial in this study that the teachers were not inadequate.
The teachers didn’t know that something was changed.
They were simply told that they were the one-student and that they were the students with the note sufficient. and just as they have taught them something and treated them.
The only real obstacle is a broken spirit a spirit, which was broken, has no hope anymore. he finds nothing more beautiful. he lacks our natural, kindly neugier. and our innate ability of imagination.
But if we manage to support the human mind, to continue to hope, to find ourselves and other people beautiful, to be curious and fantastic, then we put our forces really positively.
If a mind has these qualities, we can create a new reality and create new daseinsforms.
I want to end with a poem that was verfasst by a Persian poet named hafiz im 14th century and from them my friend jacques dembois has told me. and the poem is called &quot; the god, who knows only four words. &quot; &quot; every kind knows good, not the god of the name, not the god of the verb, but the god, who knows only four words and these constantly repeats, he says always only: komm, dance with me. &quot;
Come, dance with me. thank you very much.
How would you want to be better if you are right now?
I said that, through a few changes in their genes, they could have a better memory—precisioner, more accurate, and faster.
Or they want to be more fit, stronger, more power.
Do you want to be more attractive and self-confident?
How would it be to live longer with good health?
Or maybe you are one of those who are always looking for more creativity.
Which would you like the most?
What would you like to have if you could only have one?
The creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
He lifts your hands, let me see.
Some . probably about as many as it is creative people there are here .
That’s very good.
How many people would choose a good memory?
Just a few more.
What about fitness?
A few less.
What about longevity?
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it.
If you could only have one of them, it would be a completely different world.
Is it all just an imagination?
Or is it possible?
The evolution is a continuous topic here on the ted-conference, but today I want to give you the opinion of a doctor on the topic.
The great geneticist in the twentieth century, t.g. Dobzhansky, who also was a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church war, once wrote an insert, with the title &quot; nothing in the biology makes no mind except in the light of evolution. &quot;
Now, if you are one of those who do not accept the evidence for the biological evolution, this would be a very good time, your hörgerät to disable, take your personal communication device - I give you the permission - and<unk> you can still look at kathryn schultz &apos; buch werfen, that darum is to irren, because nothing in the further course of this network will make any mind for you.
But when they accept biological evolution, they think of the following: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
Is it geltend for others or does it affect us too?
This is another look at the baum des vivens.
In this image, I have a busch as a center of the deviations in all directions placed, for if you are the rändern des baum des lebens anschaut, all existing species an den spitzen of this zweige have in evolutionary concepts success gehabt: they have survived; it has its environment fitness and strength demonstrated.
Der menschliche Teil dieses Busches, weit am ende, is of course das, woran we are most interested in.
We double from a common prejudice to modern schimpansen before approximately six or eight million jahren.
In this zeitraum, there may be 20 or 25 different species of hominiden.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 jahren.
It seems, as if we were right abgelegen of the other part of the baumes of life, but in fact, for the greatest part, the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same.
Is it clear to them that we can use it and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can require to produce the protein of human insulin, which is used to treat a diabetic?
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically ununterscheidable from them, which comes from the bauchspeicheldrüse.
And when we are already talking about bacteria, are they aware that each of us in our darm leads more bacteria than it is cell in the rest of our bodies?
Per<unk> 10 times soviele.
I mean, you think it’s wrong, if Antonio Damasio asks after her self-image, you think about the bacteria?
Our darm is a wonderful gastro-friendly environment for these bacteria.
It is warm, it is dark, it is feucht, it is very gemütlich.
And you will offer them all the nutrients that they can only wish without effort.
It is really a lighter way for bacteria, with genetic interruptions of the unbeabsichtigten, jeodch forced stoß to the output.
But otherwise, they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria, just as they are important for their lives.
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients . and they protect them from certain diseases .
But what will happen in the future?
Are we in an art evolutionary balances in the form of a species?
Or are we determined to be something different – something that may even be better adapted to the environment?
We now go a step back in the time of the urknalls before 14 billion jahren — the erde, the sonnensystem, before about fifty and a half billion jahren — the first signs of lebewesen,<unk> before three to four billion jahren on the earth — the first more intelligent organisms,<unk> as much as 800 or a billion jahren — and then the human species, which in the last 130,000 jahren eventually form.
In this riesigen unvollendeten symphony of the universums, the life on the land is only shortly meessen; the tierreich, like a single takt; and the human lives, a small notenverzierung.
That were we.
This also puts the entertainment value of this rede dar, therefore hope I, d ass is their favourite hat.
Now, when I was a neuling on the college war, I had my first biologiekursus.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I stat, something very fundamental: in the majority the existence of living in unique organisms, each cell divides itself, and all the genetic information of the cell is further driven in both tochter cells.
But at the time, as multiple intelligent organisms emerged, things began to change.
Sexual fortpflanzung tritt ins picture.
And very important: with the introduction of the sexual reproduction, which the genom transmits, the rest of the body becomes entbehrlich.
In der Tat one could say that the inevitability of our body’s deaths in the evolution in the same moment enters as the sexual reproduction.
Now I have to gesthen if I am a college-student war, think I, okay, sex / tod, sex / tod, tod for sex - it seems quite reasonable to them time, but with every jahr, it is to my increasingly doubtful coming.
I have come to understand the feeling of George Burns, who in the Vegas presented his show in the 90s.
And one night, there is a clopfen on his hotel room door.
This type is opened.
before him stands a beautiful spärlich bekleidetes showgirl .
She looks at him an and says : &quot; I am here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; das is wunderbar &quot;, says George, &quot; I will take the soup. &quot;
I came to the recognition as a physician that I a soul hinarbeitete das anders war als das ziel der evolution - not zwangsläufig widersprüchlich, only anders.
I tried to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep them healthy.
I wanted to restore my health after a disease.
I wanted us to live a long and healthy life.
Evolution is all about the transmission of genes to the next generation, adaptation and survival generation by generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, they and I, like booster missiles, are developed to send the genetic fract to the next stages of the circuit, to let themselves then fall into more.
I think, we would all understand the stimmung, the woody all zum ausdruck brachte, as he said: &quot; I don't want immortality through my work to<unk>.
I will be achieved by I don't sterbe. &quot;
Evolution does not necessarily mean preferring the longest life.
It is not necessarily the greatest, the strongest, or the fastest, and not even the wisest.
Evolution privileges the creatures that best adapt to their environment.
It is the only test of survival and success.
On the basis of the oceans there are bacteria that are thermophilic and by this the hot damp survives and by this the hot damp survives and by this, if the fish were there, it would be a vacuum cooked fish to the folge, yet it has managed to make it a bewohnbare environment for itself.
So, what does it mean, if we look back, what is happening in the evolution, and how we think about the place of the people in the evolution, and above all, how we look forward to the next phase, I would say that there is a range of possibilities.
The first thing is that we will not develop each other.
We have achieved an art balance.
And the reasons for this would be that it is our first through medicine that it has succeeded in obtaining a mix of genes that would otherwise be selected out and removed from the population.
and zweitens, we as a spezie have uns our environment so configured that we have managed that they are an an an an an an an an an an an an an an
And of course, we wandern and circulate and mix us so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary, for the evolution, um instead to find.
A second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional art, of course, auferlegt by the creften of nature.
And the argument, here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly mahlen but they are unerbittlich.
And so far as the isolation goes, if we as species ferne planets besiedeln, it will be the isolation and the changes in the environment that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a verlockende, fascinating and scary possibility.
I nenne is neo-evolution - the new development that is not simply natural, but led and decided by us as individuals. in the decisions that we make.
How did that happen?
How could it be possible that we could do this?
Let us first look at the reality that the people today, in some cultures, make decisions about their success.
They are, in some cultures, the wahl to have more men than women.
It is not necessarily good for society, but it is what the individual and the family decide.
They also think, if it would not only be possible that the gender of their kinds to choose but also an body genetic adjustments to produce that diseases would heal and vorzubeugen.
What if they could do the genetic changes to eradicate diabetes or Alzheimer’s disease or to reduce the risk of cancer or stroke?
Would they not want to make these changes in their genes?
When we look forward, this art of change will become more and more possible.
The human genome project began in the year 1990 and lasted 13 years.
It costs $2.7 billion.
In the following year, as it was 2004 fertig war, they were able to do the same tun for $20 million in drein up to four months.
Today, they can complete a sequence of three billion basenpaare of human genoms at a price of about $20,000 and in the space of about one woche.
It will not take longer until the reality will be that there will be the $1,000 human genome, and it will be increasingly available to everyone.
before a woche, verlieh der national academy of engineering den draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer, two scientists who independently developed the natural process of evolution to encourage, to work faster and to lead desirable proteins in a more efficient weise - which francis arnold &quot; direct evolution &quot; calls.
For a couple of years, the lasker-preis of the scientists shinya yamanaka was awarded for his forschung in der er a adult hautzelle nahm, a fibroblasten, and through the manipulation of only four genes that the zelle induced to cause them to a pluripotent stammzelle - a zelle potential in der lage is any zelle in your body to become.
These changes are coming.
The same technology, which causes human insulin in bacteria produced, can make virens, which can serve not only to protect themselves, but also to immunity against other virens.
whether it is believed or not, it is an experimental study in gang with a smoke against influenza that is in the cell of a tobacco plant being cultivated.
Can you imagine something good, that from tobacco comes?
Today everything is a reality and in the future it will be much more possible.
There are only two other small changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your body?
What would be if they could not change the sperm and eizellen or the fresh fertilized to give their child a better chance for a healthier life – eliminating diabetes, eliminating hemophilia, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn’t want children to be healthy?
And then the analytical technique, the same engine of science that the changes can enable, in order to prevent disease, could also enable us to admire super-attribute, hyper-capacities - the better memory.
Why not have the schlagability of a ken jennings hben, especially if man is erweitern can with the next generation of the watson machine?
Why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer?
Why not live anymore?
These will be unwiderstehlich.
And if we are an one star, in which we can transmit it to the next generation, and we can adopt the attribute we want, we will be transformed from alt-style evolution to neo-evolution.
We will have a process that, as a rule, may require 100,000 jahre, and we can compress it to a thousand jahre - and<unk> even to the next 100 jahre.
These are decisions with which their simple, or their simple, decisions must be dealt with.
Do we use these decisions to form a society that is better, that is more successful, that is more friendly?
Or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others of us?
Will we become a society shaping dielangweiliger and uniformierer is, or robuster and vielseitiger?
These are the kinds of questions that we have to face.
And am the deepest of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and master the wisdom that we will need to make these decisions wise?
Im good as im bad, and sooner as you may think, these decisions will be on us.
Thank you .
I want them to imagine something now, a trable robot that gives them supernatural skills, or another that helps the rollstuhlers to get up and go again.
We at berkeley bionics call this robot exoskelette.
They are nothing but something that they set up in the morning and that gives them extra strength and that their speed will continue to rise and that will help them, for example, maintain their balance.
This is the true merger of man and machine.
But not only that — so that they blend and vernetze themselves with the universe and other geräten out there.
This is not just a foolish idea.
In order to show them now what we are working, we begin with talking about the American soldier, who in average wears about 100 pounds on his back and there is the question that they should carry more equipment.
Of course, this leads to some significant complications -- rückenverletzungen, 30 percent of which -- chronic rückenverletzungen.
We also thought that we would accept this challenge and create an exoskelet that would help solve this problem.
Let me present you now also hulc -- or the human universal load carrier.
soldat : with them hulc-exoskelett can I 200 pfund over various kinds of terrain tragen , many hours long .
Its flexible design enables it to carry out deep to hocken, to ruschen and highly wendige movements.
It feels what I want to do, where I go will and erhöht then my strength and austauer.
We are so far, with our industry partner this gerät vorzustellen, this new exoskelet this year.
It is also true.
Let us now look at the rollstuhlfahrer richten, something that I am especially passionate about.
There are 68 million people worldwide estimated in the rollstuhl sitzen.
This is approximately one percent of the total population.
This is a conservative assessment.
We often talk here about very young people with rückenmarksverletzungen, who in der blütezeit ihres lebens -- 20er, 30er, 40er -- vom schicksal were affected and the rollstuhl is the only option.
But it’s also about the alternate population, whose number becomes vervielfacht.
And so quite the only option — if it’s about a hirnschlag go, or about other complications — is the rollstuhl.
And so is it of course since 500 years, since its, as I have to say, very successful introduction.
We also thought that we could begin with a completely new chapter to write im bereich mobility.
Let me imagine them now elegs, that by amanda boxtel will be taken, that vor 19 jahren a rückenmarksverletzung erlitt, that zum ergebnis hat, that she could not run anymore since 19 jahren and until now.
A lot of thanks.
As I said, Amanda wears our elegs.
It has a sensor --
Its completely non-invasive sensors in the cracks, which send the signal back to our onboard-computer, which is fixed here on their back.
Here are also battery packages, the motorantrieb is located in their hyften, ebenso as in their kniegelenken, which they vorwärts moving in this quite smooth and very natural gangart.
I was 24 years old and in bestform, as a monströser purzelbaum while a skiabfahrt paralyzed me.
I lost every feeling and every movement under my beckens.
not long danach wrote a doctor in my hospital room and he said: &quot; amanda, they will not be able to go again. &quot;
And that was 19 years ago.
It is stahl every fünkchen hope out of my consciousness.
Adaptive technologies have made it impossible for me to learn, to ski again, to clettern, and even to ride with the hand of the hand.
But nothing was invented that would let me go back, until now.
A lot of thanks.
As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them.
It lies in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations—not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the rollers, but for all.
A lot of thanks.
zu hause in New York, bin ich chief of the development department of a non-profit organization named Robin Hood.
If I do not fight the armour, I will fight as the help of a firewehr-headman at a volunteer firewalk.
Now, in our city, in which volunteers support a highly qualified berufsfeuerwehr, one must be quite early in the brandstelle to be able to join.
I am reminded of my first fire.
I was the second volunteer an der brandstelle, and I also had a pretty good chance to get here.
But it was still a wet training against the other volunteers to reach the responsible heuptman and find out what our tasks would be.
As I den hauptmann fand, I had just been in a very serious conversation with the house owner who<unk> had one of the worst take their lives.
It was in the middle of the night and she stood in the sleep and barfuß under a scream out in the flowing rain, while her haus in flammen stand.
The other volunteer, der knapp vor mir angekommen war — let us call him lex Luther — reached the chief executive as the first and was asked to go in the house and to save the dog of the house owner.
I was sprachlos before them.
da war some lawyer or vermögensverwalter, who nun for the rest of his lives, the man could tell that er in a brennendes haus went about a life to save, just because he was five seconds faster than me.
I was the next one.
The chief man wiped me to himself.
He said, &quot; bezos, you have to go in the house.
They have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up, they have to go up.
I swear it.
Now, not exactly, what I had hoped, but I went up—the treppen high, the flur entlang, an den &quot; real &quot; feuerwehrmännern vorbei, which at this time with them dissolve had already been quite ready, in the bedroom about a couple of shoes to holen.
I know what you think now, but I am not a held.
I trug my beute back to down, where I am an der haustür my erzfeind and the beloved dog traf.
We trugen our treasures after outside to the hausbesitzerin, wo, not surraschend, his substantially more attention bekam than my.
A few weeks later, the Feuerwache received a brief of the Hausbesitzerin, in which she thanked herself for the tapferen use in the rescue of her houses.
A more than all measured kindness: someone had even brought her a few shoes.
Both in my beruf at Robin Hood and in my sideberuf as a volunteer feuerwehrmann bin I zeuge of generosity and kindness in the great maßstab, but I see also taten of the next love and of the mutes of the individual.
Do you know what I have learned?
They are all important.
If I also see myself in this room and people who either have already achieved a remarkable success or are on their way there, I would like to offer the following reminder: do not wait.
Don’t wait to make a difference in another’s life until they’ve reached their first million.
If you have something to give, give it now.
They serve them in a soup kitchen, they run a park in the neighborhood on,
Be a mentor.
Not every tag will give us a chance to save a man’s life, but every tag will give us the opportunity to change one.
Also put them up; save them the shoes.
A lot of thanks.
Bruno guissani: mark, mark, komm back.
A lot of thanks.
I am just coming back from a community that knows the mystery of the fortstands of mankind.
a ort, an dem die frauen das zepter leads, with sex &apos; hello &apos; say, and das spiel den tag certain -- wo spaß a serious angelegenheit is.
And no, it’s not Burning Man or San Francisco.
My ladies and gentlemen, your family.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the urwald of Congo.
Bonobos are together with schimpansen our nearest living relatives.
That means, we have a common prejudice, an evolutionary grandmutter, which preds about six million jahren lebte.
Now, schimpans are known for their aggressivity.
But unfortunately, we have overbetoned this aspect in the narration of the human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other seite of the medal.
While the schimpansen of the great, terribly influential kerlen are led, the bonobo-society of the ermächtigten weibchen is led.
They have really invented themselves, because they lead to an extremely tolerant society, in which the fatal violence was not observed.
But unfortunately are bonobos am least known among the primates.
They live in the tiefen of the Congolese urwalds, and are the beobachtung only difficult to access.
The Congo is a paradox—a land of extraordinary diversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself—the scuplatz of a violent conflict, which for decades has demanded so many lives as the First World War.
It is not surprising that this destruction also threatens the survival of the bonobos.
Fleischhandel and the rückgang des baumbestandes lead to the fact that you can’t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos—and even there we’re not sure to be honest.
And yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear a hidden laughter that the beam shoots.
Who are these relatives?
We know them as &quot; love instead of krieg &quot; -affen, because they have frequent, also bisexual sex, with changing partner, and regulate so conflicts and social angels.
I say and not, that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems—because the life of the bonobos consists of more than them as sutra.
Bonobos -- like men -- love it, their life long to play.
Playing is not just a child’s game.
For us and her is a game fundamental for the binding of relationships and the care of tolerance.
In this way we learn to trust and the rules of the games.
The game increases creativity and loadability, and it is mainly about the generation of diversity -- diversity an interactions, diversity an behavior, diversity an connections.
And when you observe bonobos when you play, you see the evolutionary origin of human lachens, dances, and of rituals.
The game is the kitt, who keeps us with each other.
Well, I don't know how they play, but I'd like to show them some unique recordings just way out of the wildnis.
First a ball game on bonobo-art -- and I don't think of a football.
Also here we see a junges weibchen and menchen in a persecution game.
Look at what you can do.
das could der evolutionäre origin sein von : &quot; she packt him bei den eiern . &quot;
I just think he likes it, not true.
Yes yes !
Sex games are also common, both in bonobos and in men.
and this video is really interesting, because it shows -- and this video is really interesting, because it shows the ideenreichtum, with them man new elements ins game brings -- how the worth -- and also, how the game both trusts and promotes -- while it is at the same time unbeatable spaß power.
But the game is a formwandler.
The game is a formwandler and it can take many forms, of which many are slightly quieter, phantasievoll, neugierig —<unk> um das erstaunen again to discover.
And I want to show them, that is fuku, a junges weibchen, and she plays peacefully with wasser.
I think, just as they play we sometimes alone, and we loten limit our inner and external welten out.
And it is this playful curiosity that let us explore, and interact, and the unexpected connections that we form, are the real native body of creativity.
This is just a small pre-smack on the instant that bonobos uns in our past and present give.
But they also keep a mystery for our future, a future in which we must adapt to increasing challenges, through greater creativity and strengthening cooperation.
The mystery is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our adaptation gambler.
In order to successfully adapt to an unstable world, we have to play.
But will we do the best out of our gameplay?
The game is not albern.
But it is essential.
For bonobos and humans, the life does not exist from teeth and clowns alone.
Just if it seems hardly appropriate is the game maybe I am necessary.
And therefore, my primate colleagues, let us humble and play this gift of evolution together, while we re-discover the creativity of the comradeship and the surprising.
Thank you .
I want them to imagine themselves two pairs, not 1979, I am exactly the same tag, I am exactly the same moment, each zeugt a baby -- okay.
There are two pairs, each with a baby.
Now I do not want them to use the Zeugung for too much time, because if they imagine the Zeugung all the time, they will not listen to me.
Let’s just imagine it for a moment.
And in this scenario they imagine that in a case the sperm a y chomosome carries, that the x chromosome of the eizelle trifft.
And in those other cases, the sperm carries a x chromosome, and the x chromosome of the eizelle trifft.
Both are surviving, both are sinful.
We will come back to this people later.
In most of my activities I have two hits on.
Under a hut I am dealing with the history of anatomy.
I am a historian, and in this case I explore how men with anatomy umgingen—i.e. human body, animal body—how they umgingen with body fluids, with body concepts; how they have thought about body.
The other hut that I have taken in my work is that of the activist, as a patient lawyer — or, as I sometimes know, as an impatible lawyer — of people who are patients of medical care.
In this case, I have worked with men, who have body types, who put social norms in frage.
So, for example, I have worked with men who are Siamese zwillings, two men in one body.
I have worked with men with zwergenwuchs—that is men who were smaller than usual.
And very often I have worked with intersexual men whose gender is atypical—that is men who do not have the average male or female body type.
And as a general term, we can use the wort of intersexuality for this.
Intersexuality comes in many different forms.
I give them just a few reports for the possible types of gender variants that do not meet the male or female standards.
In one case you may have someone with a xy chromosomen base, and the sry gen des y chomosoms let the protogonaden, which we fötalen stage all have, to be worth heranwachsen.
And therefore give the worthy im fötalen stage testosterone ab.
But because this individual the receptoren lacks, in order to recognize testosterone, the body does not respond to the testosterone.
And it is called an androgen receptor defect.
Also a lot of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consistency the body develops more than the typical female course follgend.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. she becomes like a girl erzogen.
But it takes mostly until she reaches the puberty and her breasts grow and develop, but she doesn’t get her period until someone finds that there’s something different here.
And they do a few tests and find out that they instead of ovaries and breastfeeding, in reality worth carrying in themselves and that they have a y chromosome.
It is important to understand that you might think this person is actually male, but they aren’t really.
Women, like men, have in our body something that man calls adrenaline.
They are in the rear part of our body.
And the latter states androgenic her, which virilizing hormones are.
The most women, as I — I believe a typical woman to be — I know my actual chromosomenaufbau not, but I think I probably the typical have — the most women, as I speak actually on androgene an.
We produce androgens and we talk on androgens.
The fool is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgen than a woman who was born with a good, and has an androgen receptor deficiency.
Gender is also really complicated; intersexual stands not only in the non-spectrum of gender -- in a certain consideration, they can be verteilt over the entire bandwidth,
Before a few years I had the call of a 19-year-old man who was born as a young man, who was raised as a young man, who had a friend, who had sex with his friend, who lived as a man, and who had just discovered that he had an eggstocks and a baby mother.
He had an extreme form of a congenital side-rindenhyperblasia.
er hat xx chromosome, and im mutterleib, were his adjacent so strong active that they have im essentially erected a male hormone environment.
And as a consequence, his genital masculine was expressed, his gehir was the typical masculine part of the hormone spectrum exposed.
And when he was born, he looked like a boy, and no one knew anything.
And only when it was 19 years old, bekam is genügend medical problems, actually of it, because it is innerly menstruated, that the patient finds out that it is in the inner female war.
Okay, just a quick example for a variety of intersexuality.
manche menschen mit xx chromosomen, develop something, that ovotestis means, where eierstockgewebe von hodengewebe is umhulled.
We don’t know exactly why this happens.
Gender can also occur in many different variants.
The reason why children with this art of body -- whether it is zwergenwuchs or siamesic zwillinge, whether it is intersexual -- by surgeons often to the norm to be adapted, is not because this would be advantageous for their physical health.
In many cases, these people are completely healthy.
The reason why they often do different types of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories.
Typically, our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomical manifestation is associated with a particular identity.
We also have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity; being a black person means, allegedly, having an African anatomy in view of its own history.
We also have this terribly simplifying idea.
And when we are confronted with a body that actually represents something very different to us, we are confused with these categories.
We also have in our culture a mix of more romantic ideas about individualism.
And our nation is truly based on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Now you can imagine how verblüffend it is then when children are born, which are two persons in one body.
where I in the last time had experienced the most excitement, was the South African runner caster semenya lettes jahr, whose gender was put in frage at the leichatlethik world championship in Berlin.
Many journalists reject me with the frage an : &quot; what test will they do, der uns verrät, ob caster semenya weiblich or mannlich is ? &quot;
And I had to explain to the journalist that this test does not exist.
We now know that gender is complicated enough that we must admit that the nature for us has no line between masculine and female zieht, or between masculine and intersexual and female and intersexual; tastächlich are we, which this line is naturally predicted.
We also have such a situation, where, as our science continues to advance, we must understand so much more that these categories, which we have held for stable anatomical categories, which are very simple arrangements herstellten to create sustainable identity categories, are much unschärfer than we have assumed.
And this does not only apply to gender.
It is also applicable in terms of race, which appears as much more complicated, as our terminology has been accepted.
With our considerations we geraten in all possible unbequemen regions.
We use the example on the tatsache that we have at least 95 percent of our DNA with schimpansen in common.
Should we start with the tatsache that we distinguish ourselves from them only by a few nucleotides?
As we continue to advance our science, we come increasingly into a zone of unbehagen, where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories that we had vermutlich allzu simple.
We see that in all possible spheres of the human life.
One of the regions in which we see, in our present culture, in the present united states, is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about the point at which a body becomes man, so that there is another right to have than the fetal life.
We have very difficult debates —<unk> not as publicly as in the medicine — about the question, when someone is dead.
Our ancestors had never been so difficult to fight with the frage, when someone war.
They have held someone up to one feder under the nons, and when they move, they have not yet buried them.
If she doesn’t move anymore, you’ve buried her.
But today we are in a situation in which we understand human vital organs and they want to plant other human beings.
And as a fool we catch ourselves with them fighting with the really difficult question, when someone is dead, and that brings us into a really difficult fall, in which we no longer have as simple categories as before.
Now you could assume that all the breakdown of categories would really make someone like me happy.
I am politically progressive, I verteidige people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit, it makes me nervous.
To understand that these categories are really much uncertainty than we thought, makes me anxious.
And it makes me anxious about the considerations concerning democracy.
In order to tell them about this excitement, I must first confess that I am a great fan of the founder.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexists, but they were great.
I find that they were so tapfer and strong, and so radical, in them was they taten that I take myself all a few years while ertappe the schmalzige musical 1776 to see, and it is not because of the music that is absolutely to be forgotten.
It is because of them, which was 1776 with the foundation of the west.
The founders were, in my view, the original anatomical activists, and that’s why.
Was she rejected was an anatomical concept, and she replaced it by another, the radical and beautiful war, and 200 years for uns maßgeblich war.
As they all remember, our founding father lies the concept of the monarchy ab. and the monarchy was based on a very simplified concept of anatomy.
The herrscher of the old world had no concept basierend on the DNA, but they had a concept des geburtsrechts.
They had a concept of blue blut.
They were the supporters that the people who had political power should have this political power, because of the vererbten blutline vom Großvater zum Vater zum Sohn and so on.
The founder wiesen this idea back and replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and this concept said that all human beings were created equally.
They leveled the playground and decided that anatomically seen, that communities contained, not that differences, and that was very radical.
Now they make them to share because they were a part of an enlightenment system, in which two things together heranwuchsen.
The democracy wuchs heran, but zur selben zeit wuchs also the science heran.
When you look at the history of the founding father, it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalist world.
They went away from declarations of supernatural art, and wiesen things, such as a supernatural concept of power, back, where the translation is based on a very vagen concepts of birth law.
They move to a naturalist concept hin.
And, for example, when you look at the Declaration of Independence, they speak about nature and the god of nature.
They do not speak of God and the nature of gods.
They speak of the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as part of it, they gave us a concept that the anatomical communities acted.
And thus they have prepared the future bourgeois rights movement in a truly wonderful way.
They didn’t think so much about it, but what they had for us getan, was great.
Was it happen also jahre danach?
for example, used women, who are the wahlrecht anstrebten, the concept of the founding father, which says that anatomical commonness is more important than the anatomical differences, and sagten, &quot; that we have a gebärmutter and eggstocks is as differences not significant enough, that we should not have the wahlrecht, the right to full citizenship, the right property to possess, etc, etc. &quot;
And women argue that they succeed.
as next kam the successful bürgerrechtsbewegung, wo we menschen sahen as sojourner truth, the spach over, &quot; bin i no woman? &quot;
We find men in the marching ranks of the bürgerechtsbewegung, who say, &quot; I am a man. &quot;
Again, humans of different height colors, who call themselves on anatomical communities before anatomical differences, again, successfully.
We see the same in the Behindertenrechtsbewegung.
Of course, the problem is that, as well as we begin all the communities to look at, we begin to have in frage to put in question why we maintain certain exercises.
Well, well, I want to maintain certain training, anatomically seen, in our culture.
For example, I do not want to give a fish the same rights as a man.
I don’t want to say that we should completely abstain from the anatomy.
I don’t want to say that five-year-olds should have the right to give their consent to sex or to marry.
There are also some anatomical exercises that make mind for me, and which we, I think, should maintain.
But the challenge is to try to find out who they are and why we keep them, and whether they are meaningful.
We also come back to these two beings that are zu beginn des vortrags gezeugt.
We have two wesen, both not 1979 am exactly the same tag gezeugt.
Let us make sure that one of them, Mary, was born three months later, she is also born on June 1, 1980.
Heinrich, on the other side, is born to the birth date, is also born on 1 March 1980,
Only because of the tatsache that Maria was born 3 months later, erlangt she all possible rights three months before heinrich — the right to have a common sex, the right to choose, the right to drink.
Heinrich must wait on all these, not because he is actually a different biological alter hat, only because of the times of his birth.
We will find other merchandises regardless of what their rights are.
Heinrich, as man admits that er mannlich is — although I haven’t told them that er der mit xy is — as man admits that er mannlich is, can er now be engaged, what maria does not have to worry.
Mary, however, cannot perceive the same right in all Bundesstaaten, which heinrich has in all states, and that is, the right to marry.
Heinrich can in any state a woman marry, but Maria can today only in few states a woman marry.
We also have these durable anatomical categories that are in many ways problematic and fragile.
And for me, the question is: what will we do, because our science makes such progress in the range of anatomy that we reach a point in which we must admit that a democracy based on anatomy could break down?
I do not want to give up the science, but at the same time it feels sometimes so an, as if the science makes itself independent.
Where are we going too?
It seems like our culture would take an art pragmatic attitude: &quot; good, we have to somewhere a line, so we have to somewhere. &quot;
But a menge leute finds himself in a very peculiar position.
Also for example, has texas an one point determined that a man to marry means that a man has no y chromosom, and a woman to marry means that a man has a y chromosom.
In practice, humans are not tested on their chromosomes.
But it’s also very bizarre because of the history that I’ve told them anfangs over the androgen receptor-defect.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, offers er uns in his &quot; I have a trauma rede &quot; an art solution an.
Er said, we should humans not according to &quot; their high color, but according to the properties of their characters &quot; judge, and go so beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, &quot; yes, that sounds like a really good idea. &quot;
But how do you do this in practice?
How do you judge a man because of his character character?
I also want to point out that I am not sure that we should distribute rights in bezug on men derart, because I have to admit that I know a reihe of golden retriever, which is probably social benefits more earned than a few people I know.
I would like to say that I probably also know some helle labradorhunde who are more capable of being fundiertere, intelligentere and reifere decisions regardless of their sexual relationships to encounter as a manche 40-year-old I know.
How should we also operate the phrase by the properties of the character?
It looks like it’s really difficult out.
And some of me wonder, what would it be if the content of a personality was something that in the future would be machine-readable—which could be made visible through fmri?
Do we really want to go in that direction?
I’m not sure where we’re going.
What I know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the U.S. is the leader in it, to think about the questions of democracy.
In our efforts for democracy, we have done our sages well, and I think we would do our sages well in the future.
We don’t have the situation, as it is for example in Iran the fall is, where a man who feels sexually sexually to other men will be punished with them, unless he is willing to undergo a gender change, in which case he can remain alive.
The state of this art does not exist with us.
I am froh to be able to say that we don’t have this condition—a surgeon with them I am vor a couple of jahren sprach who had a couple of Siamese twins hergebracht with themselves to run them, partly to make a name for themselves.
But when I called to him, and asked him, why is it that these invaders made – it was highly risky operations – his answer was that in his country, these children would be treated very badly, and therefore he had to be treated very badly.
I answer him, &quot; now they have political asylum in consideration gezogen instead of an operation um they to train ? &quot;
The united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are, without they want to change themselves.
That’s why I think we need to be the leader.
Well, only um to conclude, I want to notice that I have talked a lot about that water.
And I want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look, or could have appeared, if we were more involved with the mothers.
And I want to say something that is something radical for a feminist, and I think there may be different kinds of insights that are dominated by different kinds of anatomy, especially when men apply a group thought.
Since jahren already, because I am an intersexuality interested war, I have also interested in forschung im bereich der geschlechterdifferenz.
And one of the things that I really interesting fan is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world.
What we have experienced from cross-cultural studies is that women, in average — not every, but in average — are more likely to tend to complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable within the group, to pay a lot of attention.
And that’s why, when we think about it, we have an interesting situation before us.
Vor jahren, if I do a start-up, fragte me one of my study betreuer, where my interest in feminism knows — I consider myself as a feminist, so tue it yet — a truly strange phrase.
er said, &quot; say me, what am feminism weiblich is. &quot; say me, what am feminism weiblich is. &quot;
And I thought, &quot; now, that's the dumbest phrase I've heard.
Feminism goes is darum klischees over gender aufzulösen, therefore is am feminism nothing weiblich.
But the more I thought about his phrase, the more I thought that there could be something female in feminism.
That should be said, there could be something, in the average, by means of which the female gehirne of the male differences was our attention to the highly complex social relationships power, and our attention to the schutzbedürftige to care.
Where the founding father was also extremely bedacht to find out how individuals could be protected before them, it is possible that if we incorporate more mothers into this concept, we are more a concept of fighting, not only how one protects, but how we can worry for each other.
And maybe it is that where we go in the future must, if we lead democracy beyond anatomy -- less over the individual body nachzudenken was identity concerned, and more over relations nachzudenken.
So, if we as a people try to make a more perfect bond herzustellen, we think about what we can do for each other.
A lot of thanks.
I am bin Jessie and this is my suitcase.
But before I show them what I have in, I will make a very public gestancy, and that is: I am besessen of outfits.
I love it, at every occasion a different colorful, crazy outfit to find, to tragen, and in the latter time also to photograph and to blog.
I do not buy anything new.
I get all my clothes out of second hand on flohmärkten and in second-hand-shops .
Oh, thank you very nice.
Second-hand-shopping allows me to reduce the influence of my closet on the environment and also to reduce it on my wallet.
I meet all possible great people; my dollars serve for usual a good purpose; I see quite unique out; and it makes shopping to my very personal treatzsuche.
I mean, what will I find today?
Will it have my size?
Would I like the color?
Will it cost less than $20?
When all the answers go and go, I feel like I’ve won.
I will come back to my suitcase, and tell them what I have packed for this exciting woche here at the time.
I mean, what does someone bring with so many outfits me?
I will also show you exactly what I have contributed to.
I’ve got seven-pairs underhosen, and that’s all.
Underhosen for exactly one woche are all that I have getan in my suitcase.
I’ve wedded that I’d find everything else, what I might want to tragen, if I’m first after palm springs.
And since they have not heard of me as the woman, who is here at Ted in her underwashing, thinks, I have found a few stuff.
And I definitely want to show you my outfits for this woche.
Does it sound good?
While I kill, I will also give them some of the lessons, which I, whether they believe or not, have learned from these abenteuerns, to bring nothing new.
Let us start with the Sunset.
I don’t give you the strahlenden tiger.
You don’t have to spend a lot of money to see a toll.
You can almost always look great for less than $50 .
This whole outfit, including the jacke has me 55 costed, and it was the dearest piece that I carried in this whole woche.
Colour is somewhat powerful.
It is fast physiologically impossible to be badly launt when man hellrote hosen carries.
If you’re happy, you’ll be happy with other people.
Dienstag: Adaptation is total overvalued.
I have spent a lot of time in my lives trying to be myself and at the same time adapting myself.
Just be sure who you are.
If they surround themselves with the right people, they will not only understand it, they will also appreciate it.
Wednesday: umarmen sie ihr inneres kind.
Sometimes say me leute, I say out, as if I play or that I remember her seven-year-old.
I smile then like and sage, &quot; thank you beautiful. &quot;
Donnerstag: Self-confidence is the key.
If they think they see in something good out, then it’s fast sure so.
And if you think you don’t look good in something, you’re probably right too.
I wuchs with a mutter up, who gives me the tag for tag lehrte.
But only when I was 30, I really understood what that meant.
And I will summarize the course for you.
If they believe that inside and outside they are a wonderful person, then there is nothing they cannot carry.
There is also no apology for anyone here in this audience.
We should be in der lage, everything to rocken, what we want.
A lot of thanks.
Freitag: a universal truth – five wörter: goldene pailleten passes to all.
and letztendlich, samstag: developing a own, unique, personal style is a great art to tell the world something about one, without having to say a word.
It has been shown to me again and again, when in this woche men to stone on me, just because of them, what I trug. and I had great conversations.
Obviously, that will not all in my winzigen suitcase fit.
Before I go home to Brooklyn, I will spend it all again.
Because the lesson that I self this woche attempt to learn is that it’s okay to leave them.
I have to not emotionally encourage these things, because just about the ecke it will always be another crazy, colorful, brilliant outfit, that only awaits me, if I love a little im herzen have and it is suche.
I thank them vielmals.
Thank you very nice.
Good day, all together.
I have something here that I want to show you.
They think this as a picture point, as a flying picture point.
That is, what we in our labor, perceptibles design not.
Let me tell you a little about it.
If they now take this image – I am originally Italian, and every young man in Italy grows with this image in his zimmer up. but the reason why I give them this is that in the Formula 1 in the past decades something very interesting happened.
Vor einiger Zeit war es so that if they wanted to win a Formula 1 race, then they nahmen their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then they won the race.
nun heutzutage, they need, if they want to win a race, actually something like this here – something was the car in real time monitored, a few thousand sensors have, the informationen from the car, this informationen to the system, and they then process and they then use it to send this car decisions back and things in real time change while information is collected.
This is what they would call, in engineering teams, a real-time control system.
And in the ground, it is a system that consists of two parts – one sensitive part and one reactive part.
was heutzutage interesting is, is the echtzeit-control systems begin in our lives opzutauchen.
Our cities have been, in the last few years, just equipped with networks and electronics.
They become a computer in free.
And as a computer in free, they fangen an, to other art and weise to react, they are perceived and angetrieved.
If we’re in the city, it’s really a big thing.
I would like to mention that cities are only two percent of the forest surface, but 50 percent of the world’s population lives there.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption – causing up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we do something with the cities, that’s a big thing.
Beyond the cities, see all of this to perceive and enter into the objects of everyday life.
Das is by an exhibition, which paola antonelli for moma later im jahr, while des sommers, organized.
It is said &quot; sprich mit me . &quot;
Now, all our objects, our environment, fangen an, zu uns back to speak.
In a certain mind, it is fast as if every atom is out to both, a sensor and an entrepreneur.
And that changes radically the interaction that we human beings have with our environment outside.
In some way, it is fast as ob der alte traum von michelangelo.
They know, as michelangelo den moses formte, it is said that er am ende den hammer nahm and him on moses warf – in fact they can still see a small star untendrunter – and said, rief, &quot; why not talk? &quot; why sprichst you not? &quot;
Now, today, our environment fängt zum allerersten mal an, uns zu antworten.
I will only show you a few<unk> – again, with the idea that our environment will be perceived and driven.
Let us begin to perceive them.
The first project that I want to present to you is actually one of our first labs.
Es entstand vor viereinhalb jahren in Italy.
And what we’ve got, it was actually a damals new art of networking to use, which has been used throughout the world – that’s a mobile phone network – and anonymous and aggregated information from this network to use, which will anyway be collected from the operator to understand how the city works.
The summer was a happy summer – 2006.
It was as the Italian the football-world championship won.
Some of them will remember, it was as Italian against frankreich played, and then am ende zidane, der kopfstoß.
Italy has won, Italy has won.
Now you see an was an this tag passerte, only when observing the activity that im netzwerk passert.
Here you can see the city.
They see in der nicht das Colosseum, den fluß tiber.
I am tomorrow, before them play.
You see up the zeitachse.
Early afternoon, people here and there, those calls and move.
The game fängt an – Switzerland.
French makes a tor. Italian makes a tor.
Halbzeit, the men do a short call, go to the toilet.
The second half time is the end of the normal time.
The first extension, the second.
Zidane, in an instant der kopfstoß.
Italy is winning, yes.
Now, this night, they all went to the center of um zu feiern.
They saw the great outbreak.
At the next tag, all in the center of the sieger team and the prime minister to meet at the same time.
And then they all went down.
They see the picture of the platzes circus maximum, wo, since the Roman time, the men to the feirn hingehen – to have a big party to have, and they see the exclusion at the end of the tags.
Now, this is just an example of how we can feel the city today, on an art and weise how we can’t feel it before a few years.
This is not a human being, but a thing that we use and consume.
Now, today we know everything about where our stuff comes from.
This is a card that shows them all the chips, from which a mac computer consists, how they come together.
But we don’t know much about where the things go.
Also we have in this project actually some small markers entworfen about the mull to verfolgen while er through the system goes .
We also have with some volunteers who have helped us, before a little more than a year, in Seattle, to mark the things that they wander – different kinds of things as they can see – things that they would wander anyway.
Then we have the small chips, the small brands, clamped on the mould and began to persecute it.
Here are the results that we have just got.
From Seattle...
After a woche.
With this information we recognized that there is a menge inefficiency in the system there is.
We can do the same things in der Tat with less energy.
The data were not available before.
But das passeren a menge unnützer transport and complicator things.
The other thing, however, is that we believe that if we see one tag, that the cup that we throw away, does not simply disappear, that it is still somewhere on that planet.
And the plastic bottle, which we throw one tag away, remains there.
And if we were to show that man, then we could make a change in behavior.
This is also the basis for this project.
My colleague an der mit, assaf biderman, could tell them much more about that to perceive and the many other wonderful things that man can do with me to perceive, but I would like to come to the second part to talk, the one we at the beginning discussed and that is the implementation of our environment.
And the first project is something that we have done for a couple of jahren in Zaragoza, Spain.
It fing with a frage des bürgermeisters an, which to uns kam and said that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition, an public orten wasser as part of the architecture to use.
and the frage war: how could man connect technology, new technology with it?
And one of the ideas that I am with have been found in a work circle, war, put them in the front, and the valves, the magnetic valves, the valves, which open and close.
It was like a wasservorhang with a picture point out of wasser.
If these pictures fall, they can write on it, they can show patterns, images, text.
And they can approach him, and he will open up to let them go through, as they can see on this picture.
Now, we’ve presented the bourgeois Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we got the order to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it the digital water pavilion.
The whole building consists of wasser.
There is no gate or window, but when they approach it, it will open and let them enter.
Das Dach war also with wasser bedeckt.
And if it is windig, if they want to reduce the spritzen, they can even let the roof fall.
Or they could be the building closed and the entire architecture will be, as in this case, they know, this take, when they are the roof down, they get images of men who were there and say, &quot; they have the building destroyed. &quot;
No, they have the building not destroyed, it’s just so that the architecture beinahe disappears.
Here you can see how the building works.
They see the person who asks himself what has happened inside.
And here they see me, when I tried to not become wet when I tested the sensors that the wasser opened.
Now, I should tell them what one night passed when all the sensors stopped working.
But it was actually an even greater space that night.
All the children from Zaragoza came to them buildings, because the art as they play with them buildings was completely different.
No longer a building that would open up to let them go, but a building that still had a break and a louder in wasser, you had to jump now without becoming nass.
And the war, for us, is very exciting, because as an architect, an engineer, a designer, we always think about how the people use the things that we design.
But the reality is always unpredictable.
And that’s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with the human being.
Here is a picture of the buildings with the physical picture point, the picture point from the wasser and the projections on it.
And this is what we brought about about the following project after thinking, which I now show to them.
Imagine that these pictures might really begin to fly.
They may have small hubschrauber that fly through the air, and each of them with a small picture point with changing light – fast like a cloud that can move through the space.
Here is the video.
They pose themselves a hubschrauber vor, like den, den they have seen vorhin, which moves with others, fully synchronized.
You can have this cloud.
They can have an art flexible screen or an advertisement like this – an equal formation in two dimensions.
Or unregularly but in three dimensions, in which the thing changes, the light is, not the position of the picture point.
They can play with different species.
They put themselves in front of the screen could simply appear in different formats or sizes, in different resolutions.
But then the whole could be just a 3D cloud from the picture points, to which they can reach and through which they move through, which they can see from many, many directions.
Here you see a real flyfire-steuerung, which herabsinkt about as zuvor a equal v zu form.
When they turn the light on, it looks so out. so exactly as we have seen it before.
They imagine that each individual is controlled by mankind.
It could have an impulse that comes from humans, from the movements of humans, or similar.
I want to show you something to allererst here.
We have worked with Roberto Bolle, one of the best ballet dancers of our time – dem étoile am metropolitan theater in New York and der scala in Milan – we have captured his movements in 3d to use them as an impulse for the flyfire.
Here you see Robert Danzen.
On the left side you see the picture point, the various captured impressions.
It is at the same time a real-time-3d scan and a movement capture.
so that you can understand the whole movement.
You can do it all the time.
But then, if we once have all the picture points, they can play with it and play with the color movement schwerkraft and drehbewegung.
We want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyfire.
I want to show you the newest project in which we work.
It’s something in which we work for the Olympic Games in London.
It’s called the cloud – the cloud.
The idea is again, they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they think they
Imagine that everyone can give a small spending for a picture point.
I think that the remarkable of the gathering of the last years, the last decade, is that we are transformed from a physical to a digital world.
That has everything digitalized, knowing, and making it accessible through the internet.
Today, we can for the first time – and the Obama campaign has shown that – we can switch from the digital world, from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world.
That can, in our case, be that we use it to design and create a symbol.
This means something that is built in the city.
But tomorrow can it be, to pose the upcoming challenges – think they do an climate change or the CO2 emissions – how we can then from the digital world to the physical change.
The idea is also that we actually involve the people with, in which they do things together, collectively tun.
The cloud is again a cloud from the picture point, in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud from the particles.
And these particles are wasser, while our cloud is a cloud from the picture point.
It is a physikalisches gebilde in London, but with the picture point bedeckt.
They can move within themselves and make different types of experiences.
They can share the most important moments for the 2012 Olympics and beyond, and use it as an art of connection to the community.
Also both, the physical cloud in heaven and something in whose spitze they can hingehen, like London's neuer berggipfel.
You can hineingehen.
And an art digitaler leuchtturm in the night – but as allerwichtigstes, a new art of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top.
Thank you .
As an artist, the context is very important to me.
Through my work I try to express that men are not separated from nature and that everything is connected with each other.
Das erste Mal war ich vor beinah 10 jahren in der antarktis, wo ich my first eisberge sah.
I took an ehrfurcht.
My herz rose, my was swindelig, while I tried, zu fassen was vor me stand.
The eisberge um me herum ragten beinah 60 meters out of the wasser . and I could only be surprised that das a schneeflocke on another schneeflocke war , jahr um jahr .
Eisberge are born as the heart of a gletscher or by breaking them out of eisschollen out.
Each Eisberg has its own individual personality.
They interact on a clear way with their environment and their experiences.
Manche weigers to give up and clammern up to the bitter end, while others are no longer standing up and collapse in a dramatic passion attack.
When you look at a Eisberg, you can easily think that they are isolated, separated and alone, just as we humans often see.
But the truth is far away from it.
While a Eisberg schmilzt, I atme his premature atmosphere in.
While the eisberg schmilzt sets er mineralstoffreiches drinkwasser frei, which many livensforms feed.
I go to my recordings of this Eisberge so vor, as if I would make portraits of my ancestors, in the consciousness that they exist in these individual eyes from this way, and never again will exist so.
It is not a tod when they smell; it is not an end, but a continuation of their pfades entlang of the life cycle.
a part of the eises in the eisbergen that I photograph is very jung – some thousand jahre alt .
And a part of the Eyes is more than a hundred thousand years old.
The last pictures I like to show you, show a eisberg, which I have photographed in kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
Very rarely you will actually become the Zeuge of a Rollenden Eisbergs.
Here you see it now.
On the left side you see a small boat.
It is approximately five meters long.
Please pay attention to the form of the Eisbergs and where it is on the waterline.
You can see here, er begins to roll, and the boot has moved to the other seat, the man stands there.
This is the average size of a Greenland-Eisberg.
It is about 120 feet from the wasser, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
And just so, the Eisberg shows them another side of his personality.
I am thankful to them.
My life is really extraordinary gesegnet by the work on some amazing projects.
But with them coolsten, which I have worked, it was about this guy.
His name is tempt.
Tempt was one of the leading graphic artists of the 80s.
Then, one tag, kam er vom run back and said &quot; paps, my beine kribbeln. &quot;
And that was the outbreak of as.
Tempt is completely gelähmt today.
He can only use his eyes.
I stand in front of him.
I have a company that makes design and animations, graffiti is also necessarily a complex part of what we in the art world admire and observe.
Therefore, we have decided to support Tony – tempt – and his sages.
I met with his father and his brother and said, We will give you this money.
What are you going to do with it? &quot;
And his brother said, &quot; I will only be able to talk with Tony again.
I will only go again with him and I fragte : &quot; moment bad, is that not – I have seen Stephen Hawking – can not all humble men through these devices communicate ? &quot;
And is answered: &quot; no, only if you belong to the higher society and have a remarkable insurance, you can really tun it.
normal men are these devices not accessible. &quot;
And I answered: &quot; how do you communicate now? &quot;
has someone the film &apos; schmetterling und taucherglocke &quot; seen ?
So they communicate – so they run their finger entlang.
I staunte : &quot; very archaic , how can das be ? &quot;
I also go with them bedürfnis, just a check out and instead I put a check out of them I didn’t have the leisest awareness of how I should put it out.
I commit me an ort and stand to his brother and his father – with the words: &quot; well, my proposal is as follows: Tony will speak, we will take him an apparatus and we will find a way that he can make his art again.
Because it is a farce that someone who is all that is still in itself can not communicate. &quot;
I also spoke a few months later at a conference.
I traf this leute von grl, graffiti research lab and they have a technology that it allows them to project a light on any surface and then to draw it with a laser pointer that only the negative flags registered.
They are also moving and making art installations like these.
They say that all the things that are shown there above follow a lifecycle.
It begins with the sexsteilen, then come the schimpfwörter, then the bush-verleumdungen, and ultimately make the people actually art.
But there was always a lifecycle in their presentations.
I also went home and ate with my wife to abend and told her of everything and we thought: &quot; nun, a second bad, if there is this technology, with which man can use his eyes, to control things, then we should find a way that tempt a laser control can, so that er again can make graffiti, that would be great. &quot;
That was the beginning of the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a menge organization and a lot of hin and her of things, we have achieved some things.
erstens, we have the assurances that türen eingerannt, and have actually for tempt a device to get, with them er communicate can – a stephen hawking machine.
That was incredible.
And is really extremely witzig – I name him yoda, because man redet with him, or gets an email, and thinks: &quot; I am so unworthy, this guy is incredible. &quot;
In addition, we have seven programmers from all over the world logged in – buchstäblich aus allen ecken der welt – zu uns nach hause.
My wife, my kids and I are in the garage, and these hackers and programmers and theoretics and anarchists have taken over our house.
Many of our friends thought that we were nice dumm seien, that to tun and that we were back and all the pictures an den wenden wären graffitis gewichen.
But for more than two weeks we have programmed, we went to the beachpromenade in Venice, my kids were inbezogen, my dog also and we schufen das hier.
It is called eyewriter and you can see the description.
That’s a cheap sonnenbrille, which we have in the beachpromenade of Venice, a little kupferdraht and a few pieces from the baumarkt and the electronic trade.
We nahmen a ps3 camera, we have them auseinandergebaut, we have them set on a led-light and now we have a gerät that is free to access – man can it itself bauen, we put the code umsonst available, the software can man free to download.
We have also created a device that is completely free of restrictions.
No insurance can be covered,
Neither is there a hospital.
Each gelähmte can actually communicate or draw with his eyes alone.
Thank you .
Thank you very much, the war was incredible.
Am ende der zwei Wochen also gingen we back in tempts zimmer .
I love this image, because it is the zimmer of someone else and that is his zimmer.
There is now all this rummel before the great discovery.
And after over a jahr of planning, two weeks of programming, nudelparties, and overwhelmed nights, you marry Tony for the first time again after seven jahren.
And this is an impressive image, because this is his life-constructing system, and he sees beyond his life-constructing system.
We have his bed geneated so that he can see outside.
We have a projector set against a wand des parkplatztes vor dem krankenhaus.
And you’re marking again for the first time, in the face of his family and friends – and you can just imagine what a feeling that on the park was.
Lustigerweise we must also even in the parking place, we feel also zurecht as a part of the sprüher scene.
am ende sandte er uns a email with folgendem content : &quot; for the first time since seven jahren I have somewhat recorded .
I have the feeling that I was under wasser dribbed and finally has someone after down gegriffen and my head heightened so that I can breath. &quot;
Is this not overwhelming?
That’s something like our fighting.
It keeps us at the stand and allows us to continue to evolve.
And we have to make a lot more to improve this device.
It is a surprising gerät, but it comes to a zaubertafel like.
And someone who has a solches of artistic potential deserves so much more.
We are also at the time to find out how to be better, faster and stronger.
Since then, we have received all kinds of recognition.
We won a few prizes.
bedenken sie, it is free, no one of us deserves it.
Everything comes from our own pockets.
The awards were also, &quot; oh, the awards are fantastic. &quot;
Armstrong tweeted about us and then, in December, has uns das time-magazine geehrt, as one of the 50 best erfindungen of 2010, was really class war.
Das coolste daran is – and das closes the whole circle – that it is this April, when geffen moca in der innenstadt von los angeles a exhibition will be given namens &quot; art of the streets &quot;
And there will probably be so pretty much the hardest vertreter of the street art scene anwesend – Banksy, Shepard Fary, Caws – all these guys will be there.
Tempt will be part of the show, which is quite abgefahren.
If you see something, that is impossible, then mach is possible.
Everything in this room war impossible – this scene, this computer, this microphone, the eyewriter – everything war some time impossible.
Make it possible – you are all here.
I am not a programmer and I have not had anything to do with eye recovery technology, but I have just something erfasst and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs together.
And this question should be asked by each of them, and on each individual tag, in whom they feel something, that must be completed. if not now, when then? and if not me, who then?
I thank you.
Also, I write for kids, and I am probably the American most gelesener kinderbuchautor.
And I say the people always that I am not like a scientist therefore come will.
You can have me as a farmer, or in lead, but no one has ever chosen a farmer.
Today I want to tell you about the circle and revelations.
Well, an illumination is for usual something that you find because you’ve fallen somewhere.
You go about the block and take it as an offending war.
This is a gem of a circle.
One of my friends has it done – Richard Bollingbroke .
It is the art complicierter creis of them I want to tell you today.
mein kreis begann damals in the 60ern an der high school in stow, Ohio, where I die klassenschwuchtel war.
I was the one who was hit every woche in the jungentoilette green and blue until a teacher saved my life.
She saves my life by using me the toilette in the lehrerroom.
That makes it secret,
She tat is three years long.
I had to leave the city.
I had a daumen, I had 85 dollars, and it schlug me to San Francisco in California – I found a lover – and damals in the 80ern fand I was important to work with AIDS organizations to take on.
Vor about three or four jahren erhielt I in the middle of the night a call from this teacher, woman posten, who said, &quot; I have to see her.
I am sad that we have never learned to know each other as adults.
You can please come to Ohio, and please come together with the man, from them I know that you have found him inzwischen.
And I should mention that I have bauspeicheldrüsencrebs, and that I want them to be quick. &quot;
The next day we were in Cleveland.
We saw her an, we laughed, we weed, and we knew that she had to be in a hospice.
We found one for her, we brought her, and we took care of her, and we gave on her family eight, because it was necessary.
It was something that we knew too much.
And just as the woman, who wanted to know me as an adult, met me, she turned into a box full of ash and was placed in my hand.
was passert war, was that the cross had been closed, it was a cross becoming – and the revelation of which I have spoken showed itself.
The revelation is that death is a part of life.
She has saved my life, and my partner and I have saved her.
And you know, this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs.
It requires truth and beauty, and I am so glad that this has been mentioned so often here today.
It needs exactly – it needs to be, love and pleasure. and it is an uns to give these things.
A lot of thanks.
They are faced with a large explosion while rising to 1,000 meters.
You’ll find yourself a flight full of smoke.
Make yourself a triebwerk vor, das klack, klack, klack, klack, klack, klack, klack power.
The angst is influenced.
Well, I had a unique place on this tag; I sat on 1d.
I was the only one who was able to talk to the flybegleitern.
I saw them also right an, and they said: &quot; no problem, we have probably a few birds erwischt. &quot;
The pilot had already turned the machine and we were not so far away.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot directed the machine after the Hudson river out.
This is usually not the road.
It turned off the triebwerke ab.
You’re looking forward to a noise-free aircraft.
And then he said three words – the most emotional words I’ve heard of.
is said , &quot; readymachen zum aufprall &quot;
I didn’t have to talk to the borders anymore.
I could see it in their eyes, that was terrible, that life was to the end.
I want to tell you three things I’ve learned about myself in this tag.
I learn that at a moment everything is different.
We have this life plan, we have these things that we want to do in life and I thought of all the people to whom I wanted to make a hand rich and it didn’t do, all the zäune that I wanted to flicken, all the experiences that I wanted to do and didn’t do.
While I later thought about it, fiel me a spruch ein, der lautet : &quot; I sammle schlechte weine &quot; .
For if the wine is so far and the person is there, then I will open it.
I don’t want to move anything in my life anymore.
And this urgency, this soul, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned on this tag – and the war, when we the George Washington Bridge failed, so pretty um haaresbreite – the second thing that I learned on this tag – and the war, when we the George Washington Bridge failed, so pretty um haaresbreite – the second thing that I thought, the mensch, the second thing that I really regret.
I had a good life.
In my own humanity and with my errors, I strive to be better in everything, what I pack.
But in my humanity I have also given my ego room.
And I regreted the time that I had wasted for meaningless things, with people who mean something.
And I thought about the relationship with my wife, to friends, to men.
And then, when I thought about it, I decided to ban negative energy from my life.
It’s not perfect, but it’s much better.
I have not been fighting with my wife for two years anymore.
It feels great an.
I do not try to be right anymore; I decide to be happy.
Die dritte sache, die ich lernte – and zwar während die innere uhr beginnnt, &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; herunterzuzählen ,
You can see that the water comes.
I said, &quot; please fly in the air. &quot;
I will not that this ding in 20 you zerbricht, as man is from the documentation knows.
While we abstürzen, I had this feeling, mench, to die is not furchterregend.
It’s as if we were preparing our lives for it.
But it was very sad.
I didn’t want to go; I love my life.
And this sadness really formed itself in a thought, that I wish myself just one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month danach I visited a performance of my daughter – erstklässler, not a lot of artistic talent ...
...not yet.
And I celebrate, I cry like a little kind.
And in the world everything raises a mind for me.
me was damals clear by making me the points with each other verband that it is in life only darum goes to be a greater father.
More than anything, everything else, is my only soul in life, to be a good father.
I was the wunderful benefit, in this tag not to die.
I received another gift, that is, to see in the future, and to return and to live differently.
My call to all those who fly today is: show yourself, the same thing happens on your flight – please don’t – but show yourself; and how would they change?
What would they do that they suspend because they think they’ll be there forever?
How would they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything else, are they the best fathers that they can only be?
Thank you .
The idea behind them stuxnet computer-wurm is quite simple in itself.
We don’t want Iran to battle the bomb.
The most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranium enrichment facility in natanz.
The grauen boxen, which you see here, are real-time control systems.
If we succeed in compromising the systems that control the drehzahlen and the valve, then we can actually cause a mix of problems with the zentrifuge.
These grauen boxen do not run with windows-software; they are based on a completely different technology.
But if we find that an effective windows-virus on a laptop is one-listed, which is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this graue box, then we are in business.
And that’s the planing behind stuxnet.
We also start with a windows-dropper.
The nutzdaten will be transferred in the gray box, damaging the zentrifuge and the Iranian nuclear-energy program is delayed – the commission is carried out.
This is a child’s game, isn’t it?
I want to tell you how we have discovered that.
When we started our forschung to stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown, what was the mind and the purpose of this construction war.
Das einzige, was wir wussten is very, very complicated, was den windows- teil angeht, den dropper- teil, er machte von unzähligen zero- day- schwachstellen use.
And it seemed somewhat advanced, with this gray boxen, this real-time control system.
Das erregte our attention and we started a labor- project, in which we infected our environment with stuxnet, and studied this structure.
And then something funny happened.
Stuxnet stood like a labratte, who didn’t hate our hand, but didn’t want to eat it.
There is no mind in my eyes.
And after we had experimented with different species of hand, I realized that this is a target attack.
It is fully directed to a specific goal.
der dropper streift active on the grauen box umher, when a special configuration was discovered. even, when the special program, which it is to infect attempted on this target running.
And if not, then do stuxnet nothing.
also, that weckte really my interest and we began to work with it, beinahe round um die uhr, because I thought, now, we don't know, what the soul is.
It could, say we for example, be a US-American power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So we should better soon find out what the soul represents.
also extrahierten and decompilierten wir den angriffs- code and fanden out that er in two digital sprengköpfe is restructured -- one smaller and one bigger.
And we also trust that they were very professionally designed, by people, who obviously had all the insider- informationen available.
They know any bits and bytes that they have to attack.
You probably even know the shuhgröße des machinenbedieners.
They knew everything too.
And if you have already realized that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you: the nutzdaten are a science for itself.
It’s much anspruchsvoller than anything we’ve ever seen.
Here you can see a cut from this angriffs-code.
We are talking here for – about 15,000 Zeilen code .
It looks quite as aus, as altmodische assemblersprache.
And I’m going to tell you how we were in the low out of this code to become wise.
nach was we also as the first suchten, were system functions- oprufe, because we know, what these bewirken.
And then we sought to timern and datenstrukturen and tried to bring these into connection with the real world — with the potential goals in the real world.
We also needed theories about this ziele, which we could belegate or widerlegate.
about these theories opzustellen, we call us in remembrance that it is definitely a high-degree sabotage action, it must be a high-quality ziel trading and very likely it is in Iran, because there the most infections have been gemelded.
Now, in this region there are not several thousand ziele.
im grunde läuft es hinaus auf der buschehr atomkraftwerk und auf der urananreicherungsanlage in natanz.
also I said to my assistant, &quot; bring me a list of all experts for zentrifugen and kraftwerke from our customerstamm. &quot;
And I called them an and zapfte their knowledge an, to compare their expertise with them, what we had discovered in the code and in the date.
And it worked very well.
Also, it was possible to bring the small digital sprengkopf with the rotorsteuerung in connection.
The rotor is this moving part within the zentrifuge, this black object, that they see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, then you are actually in the low of the rotor to knock and eventually even to let the centrifuge explode.
What we have also found out is that the soul of the attacks actually war, it is slow and unheimlich to let happen -- obviously in the attempt to let the wartungsingenieure desperate, so that they would not be able to quickly come back.
The big digital sprengkopf -- we had an insight, by making us very accurate daten and datenstrukturen anschauten.
also for example the number 164 sticht very out of this code; you can’t overlook it.
I begin with this, scientific literature throughzuarbeiten, about how these zentrifugen in natanz are built and found out that they are structured in so-called cascades, and each cascade contains 164 zentrifugen.
Also das machte sinn, it’s passed together.
And it became even better.
These zentrifugen in Iran are opgeteilt in 15 so-called Eben.
And raten they was we found in the attack code?
A fast identical structure.
Also again, they really passed well together.
And this gave us great confidence for what we have studied here.
Don’t understand me wrong, it wasn’t so easy.
These results have been achieved by several week harter work.
And often we just run into a sackgasse and must uns neu sammeln.
at least we find out that both digital sprengköpfe in reality on one and the same ziel zusteuerten, but from different directions.
The small sprengkopf takes over a kaskade, and overdrives the rotor and slows it and the large sprengkopf tritt with six kaskades in interaction and manipulates the valve.
So, in great and whole we are very confident that we actually have determined what the soul is.
It is natanz and it is only natanz.
So we don’t have to worry that other ziele von stuxnet might be affected.
Here is something really cooles zeug, which we have discovered -- has me really out of the socken gehauen.
Here below is the gray box, and above draft you see the zentrifugen.
Now, what this thing is done is that it is the input value of sensors abfängt — also to the example of drucksensors and vibration sensors — and it puts a legitimate code to the disposal that is still running during their attack, with false input data.
And in fact, this false input data of stuxnet has already been captured before.
Also it’s exactly the same as in Hollywood films, where during the verfolgungsjagd the surveillance camera with previously captured videos is füttert.
It’s cool, isn’t it?
The idea here is obviously not just that the machinenbediener im controlraum overlisten.
In fact, it is even much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to overlist a digital security system.
We need digital security systems there where a human machinenbediener cannot react quickly enough.
So in a power plant for example, if the big damp turbine becomes too fast, you have to open the entlastungsventile within milliseconds.
Of course, this cannot be done by a human machine-leader.
We also need digital security systems.
And if they are in danger, then really bad things can happen.
The power plant can explode.
And neither the machine leader nor the security system will notice it.
This is fearful.
But it becomes even worse.
And that was I now wise is very important.
Remember, this attack is generic.
There is nothing special to tun with zentrifugen, with urananreicherung.
So, for example, it would work exactly as well—in a power plant or in a car factory.
It is generic.
And you don’t have to — as the attacker — you don’t have to bring the nutdaten through a USB stick, as we’ve seen it at stuxnet.
It can also be used by the usual Wurm- technology zum Verbreiten.
You just have to spread it as far as possible.
And if you do that, you will eventually get a cyber-mass destruction weapon.
That’s the consistency that we have to stand up.
So unfortunately, the greatest number for such attacks is not im mittleren osten.
They are located in the United States, in Europe and Japan.
So all these green areas, these are the zielreichest environments.
We have to set ourselves the consistency and we fangen better an uns vorzubereiten.
Thank you .
I have a question.
ralph, it has been<unk> very much of that leute vermuten that the mossad the main organization is dahinter.
Is that your opinion too?
Would you really want to know?
OK OK OK OK.
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved, but the treiband power is not Israel.
So the treibende power dahinter is the cyber-superpower.
There is only one, and these are the united states—to happiness, to happiness.
Otherwise, our problem would be even greater.
Thank you for giving us a heidenangst injected hast. thank you ralph.
I have spent the last few years placing myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somehow dangerous.
I'm in prison - it's hard.
I’ve worked in a Kohlebergwerk – dangerous.
I have in kriegsgebieten gefilmt -- difficult and dangerous.
And I’ve spent 30 days with it, nothing but eating this here – spaßig am anfang, a bit difficult in der nicht, very dangerous am ende.
In fact, I have exposed myself to the greatest part of my career to the appearance of terrible situations, and that everything is only for the attempt, social interest so to investigate that they are fesselnd and interesting, and hopefully to an art understandable, what it makes fun and accessible to the public.
When I also knew that I would come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew that I would do something a little different.
Some of them may have heard of the fact that I’ve swallowed an ad on eBay a few weeks ago.
I sent a few Facebook news, a few Twitter news, and I gave people the possibility that the name rights on my tedtalk 2011 to firsthen.
Indeed, some lucky individuals and firms, for-profit and non-profit, obtained the unique opportunity — for I am sure that Chris anderson das will not again zulassen — the name rights to buy the talk they are just seeing, which at that time had neither a title nor a lot of content and did not give many indications on what the topic would actually be.
was man also bekam, was as follows: their name here presented: my tedtalk, from them they have no awareness, what the topic will be, and from them is after content schlussendlich about the ears could fliegen, especially if I put their firm for their participation dumm dastehen lieze.
Unfortunately, this is a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many men are watching these tedtalks?
A whole mixture.
This is, of course, only the job title.
Despite this warning, I also knew that somebody would buy the name rights.
If they had asked me this before a year, I<unk>’t have been able to tell them this with certainty.
But in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project, in the new project.
As I’ve said, I’ve gone in some pretty horrible situations, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could rush me, on something so difficult and so dangerous as going into a room with this guy.
You know, I had the idea for a movie.
What I want to do is a film around product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising.
And the film will be &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; heats .
was also in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; passed, is that everything, from above to below, from the beginning to the end, completely with the mark versehen is -- from the title sponsor, from the film they will see, that is the mark x.
Nun this mark, das qualcomm stadium, das staples center...
These people will be connected with them film in eternity – forever.
And so the film will investigate all this idea—that is what? in eternity, forever?
I am a redundant person.
That was more to the emphasis.
It is war &quot; in eternity, forever. &quot;
But we will not only have the brand x as a title sponsor, but we will make sure that we will sell any possible category in the film.
So we may sell a shuh and it will be the greatest shuh that they have carried ...
The greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold, the greatest movie ever sold.
The idea is also, apart from showing that brands are a part of life, actually, to bring them to the film to finance?
And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of all films is transparency.
You’ll see the whole story in the film von statten.
This is also the whole concept, the whole film, from the beginning to the end.
And I would be glad if CEG would help realize this.
They know, it’s funny, because when I’ve heard it first, it’s the ultimate respect for the audience.
But I don’t know how empfänglich people will be.
They have a perspective -- I don't want to use &quot; blickwinkel &quot; because das has a negative connotation -- but they know how it will develop?
How much money is needed to realize this?
1.5 million dollars.
I think it’s going to be hard to meet them, but I think it’s on one fall worth talking about some truly well-known brands.
Who knows, if the film then comes out, we may see it like a horde full-idiot out.
What do you think, how will the answer be?
The answer will be highly likely &quot; no &quot; sein .
But is it a difficult thing because of the films or a difficult thing because of me?
JK: Both of them.
And that means, not so optimistic.
Can you help me? I need help.
I can help.
Okay okay.
Fantastic .
We need to consider which brands.
Yes yes.
If you look at the people you have to do with...
There are some positions that we can wenden.
Put the camera off.
I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think
es stellte out that it is in reality meaning, &quot; we want to have nothing to do with their movie. &quot;
And just so all these firms disappear, one after the other.
No one wanted to have anything to do with the movie.
I was surprised.
They did not want to have anything to do with the project.
And I was confused, because I thought, the whole concept, the idea of werbung is, to present your product to as many people as possible, to let as many people as possible see it.
Especially in the present world, in this interface of new and old media and the broken media landscape, it is not the idea to be in this new exciting transmittlungs tool that the masses bring this message.
No, the war, what I thought.
But see you, the problem was that my idea had a fatal error, and that was the following.
In fact, no, that was not a mistake at all.
That<unk>’t have been a problem at all.
That would have been ok.
But what this picture stands for is a problem.
see them, if they are transparent at the google-such entered is das -- this is one of the first images, das erscheint.
I really like your art, Sergey Brin.
The war of the problem: transparency -- free of cheating and thickness, easy to discover and see; immediately understandable; characterized by visibility and the access to information, especially, what business practices are concerned -- the last zeile is<unk> the greatest problem.
You know, we are now hearing a whole mix of transparency.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our ceos say it.
But when it comes to the extent that it is to be implemented, something changes.
But why? now, transparency is angst influencing—as this bizarre bear, which always brilliates.
It’s unvorhersagbar—like this seltsame landstraße.
It is also very risky.
Is it risky otherwise?
A whole scale of cool whip essen.
This is very risky.
When I also begin to talk to the firms and tell them that we want to tell this story, they say: &quot; no, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we want you to tell our story. &quot;
If I was a kind and my father raised me when I lie, and if I sit and look at me with this look, I would say, &quot; my sohn, there are three versions in every story.
There is your version, there is my version, and there is the true version. &quot;
You can also see, with this film we want to tell the true version.
But when only one company, one agency was ready to help us – and that’s also just because I know John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum since jahren – I made it clear that I had to do it alone, I had to do it with the mittelsmann and go directly with my team to the firm.
What they suddenly began to understand – or what I began to understand – was that, when you begin to talk to these companies, the idea of how your brand will be understood is a comprehensive problem.
I have friends who make big, giant Hollywood movies, and I have friends who make the small independent movies like I do.
And my friends, who make big, giant Hollywood movies, say that the reason why their movies are so successful lies in the brand partner they have.
And then say my friends, who make small independent-films, &quot; now, how should we compete with these big, giant Hollywood-films? &quot;
And the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold. &quot;
How exactly will we also be forbidden to watch in that movie?
Every time I get on that road, and every time I open the medical warehouse, they will see the ban deodorant.
And every time I interview someone, I can say: &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview?
You look a bit nervous.
I want to help you calm up.
Per<unk> you should also place a little hiervon up before the interview. &quot;
And then we offer one of these great dust an.
either &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds &quot;, they will have the wahl.
We will be equipped for both men and women -- party, roll-on, or a stick, whatever.
This is the curriculum.
Now I can answer all your questions and give you an inexhaustive formulation.
We are a smaller brand.
As you have spoken about the smaller films, we as a brand are a challenge.
We also do not have the same budget as other brands.
Such things also to do — they know, erinnert leute an ban — that’s somehow why we are interested.
Which words would you describe the ban?
The ban is white.
This is a great phrase.
FRAU: superstitious technology.
Technology is not the art, as one should describe something, that someone is under the achseln tut.
We speak of Khn, fresh.
I think, &quot; fresh &quot; is a super wort that this category really makes something positive, im gegensatz zu &quot; fighting odor and moisture. &quot;
It keeps you fresh.
How can we keep them fresh for longer – better fresh, more fresh, dreimal fresh.
Such things have a more positive effect.
And that’s a millionen group.
What is it with me? what is it with those druchschittstypen?
I have to talk to those men on the street who are like me, otto-normal-consumer.
Let me tell you something about my brand.
How would you describe your brand?
What is my brand?
I don’t know.
I really like beautiful clothes.
frau: 80er revival trifft on skaterpunk, except am waschtag.
What is the Mark Gerry?
Unique is.
I think, das genre, der style, den I have, is well &quot; dark glamour &quot;.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grautöne and so a zeug.
But normally I have an accessory, such as sunny glasses, or a jewelry and so a zeugs.
If it were a brand, it would probably be a classic Mercedes Cabrio.
Man 2: the mark, which I am, is, I would say, the flight.
2 : teils hippie , teils yogi , teils brooklyn-mädchen -- I don't know .
Man 3: I am the schmusetyp.
I sell schmusetiere throughout the country, worldwide.
I also think that’s my brand.
That’s my brand in my small, distorted industry.
Man 4: My brand is fedex because I was ausliefere.
mann 5 : marke gescheiteter alcoholsüchtiger schreiberling .
Does that go?
I am an advocate.
I am Tom.
Well, we can't all the tom-marke be, but I see myself often an the interface of dark glamour and lässiger fliege.
And what is noticed, was that I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could really help me to understand, what man die &quot; brand personality &quot; calls.
And so I found a company named Olson Zaltman in Pittsburgh.
They have firms like nestle, fever, hallmark geholfen, to discover this brand personality.
If they could do it for the tun, they could<unk> help me too.
You’ve made your pictures, right?
The first picture is a picture of my family.
Tell me a little about how it is connected with your thoughts and feelings about yourself.
These are the people who shape my worldview.
Tell me about this world.
I think, the own world is the world, in which man lives—as men um a herum, the friends, the family, the art, how man his life lives, the work, and so on.
All these things come from and start from a place, and for me they come from and start with my family in west virginia.
What is the next, about which they want to talk.
This was the most beautiful tag of my lives.
In what context does that stand to the thoughts and feelings about yourself?
It’s the way I want to be.
I like things that are different.
I like things that are strange, I like things that are strange.
Tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what does it bring us?
What is the machete? in which puppen stage are you currently?
Why is it important, neuzustarten? was representing das rot?
Tell me a little about this part.
A little bit more about you, that’s not you.
Which other metamorphosis have you passed through?
In which art of background are you? in which art of background are you?
No, no, thanks to you!
Thank you very much for your patience.
Well now. well now.
I don’t know what Darwin will do.
There were a lot of crazy things happening.
Das erste, was I sah, was this idea that their brandpersonality two getrennte, but the ergänzende seiten has -- the morgan spurlock-marke is a achtsame / verspielte brand.
They complement themselves very well.
And I think there is almost a contradiction with it.
And I think some companies will focus only on one strength, rather than on both.
Many firms tend to avoid — and that’s the human nature — things in which they’re not sure, they’re going to avoid fear, these elements, and that they call them welcome, and they actually turn them for themselves into something positive, and that’s a schickter schachzug.
Which other brands trade so?
The first is a classic, Apple.
And you can also see it here, target, wii, mini von mini coopers and jetblue.
Now, there are verspielte marken and achtsame marken, these things that come and go, but a verspielte, achtsame marke is a pretty strong thing.
What is a brand, what is a brand, what is a brand?
If someone would ask her to describe her brand identity, her brand personality, what would she be?
Are you a up-attribute? are you something that brings the blood in wallungen?
Or are you a down-attribute?
Are you something that is a little more calm, more reservier, more conservative?
Up-attribute are things that are verspired, fresh like the fresh prince, zeitgemäß, abenteuerlich, ausgefallen and lieblich like erol flynn, wendig and agile, profan, herrisch, magical and mysterious like gandalf.
Or are you more like a down-attribute?
Do you think it’s like 007?
are they established, traditional, pflegend, beschützend, mitfühlend like oprah?
Are they reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, holy, bedacht and weise as der dalai lama or yoda?
In the laufe des films we had more than 500 firms that were up and down-firmen and the &quot; no in &quot; sagten because they didn't want to be a part of the projects.
They<unk> wanted to have nothing to do with this film because they had no control, no control over the fertige product.
But there will be 17 brand partners who were willing to give up this control, who wanted to do business with someone as careful and disturbed as I am, and who will eventually enable us to tell stories that we normally couldn’t tell – stories that a advertiser normally<unk>’t support.
They are able to tell us the story of the neuromarketing, as we tell the story in this film, that man today uses mris, to the lustzentren des hirns, to make both a werbung and a film.
We fuhren nach Sao Paulo, where outdoor advertising is prohibited.
In the entire city, for five years there has been no anzeigentafel, no poster, no flyer, nothing.
And we fuhren in schulbezirke, where firms take their way in verarmte schools, throughout America.
The incredible for me is that the projects of which I do the most feedback bekam or where I had the greatest success, they are where I directly interacted with things.
And that’s what these brands have gotten,
Because they umgingen the mittelsmann, they umgingen the agencies, and they say that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind.
I’m going to negotiate directly with the artist.
I will work with him and create something completely different, something that brings the people to think, that our worldview challenges.
What was the success for you? what was the success for you?
Now, since the film at the Sundance Film Festival had the premiere, we can uns das mal watch.
laut burrelles was the premiere in January, and since then — and that’s not even the whole thing — there were 900 million reviews of this film.
Das umfasst actually only a zeitraum of 2 1 / 2 weeks.
That’s just online – no press, no television.
The film has not yet been released.
It’s not even online, it’s not streaming.
He has not yet come out in other countries.
Now, finally, the film has a very big momentum erlangt.
And that’s not bad for a project, with them fast every advertising agency, with which we talked, their customer recommended hat, to let the finger out of it.
Something, which I celebrate, is that if you take your chance, the risks come into that in these risks the possibilities stecken.
I believe, if you keep people from it, then you bring them closer to failure.
I believe that, when a man training his angestellten, to avoid risks, a man the whole company is prepared to make a profit.
I have the feeling that when we advance, we need to encourage people to take risks.
We need to encourage people, not to be afraid of the possibilities they may be scary.
Finally, when we speak, we should call the fear welcome.
We should den bär in den käfig stecken.
Heat they are the angst welcome. heat they are the risk welcome.
Each of them has a large loffel full, so we call the risk welcome.
And finally, we should welcome transparency.
Heutzutage, more than you’re overwhelming, brings us a little honesty very far.
And that said, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk &quot; heated she transparency welcome &quot; was presented to them by my good friends of emc, the $7100 for the name rights at ebay free.
Big data will be converted to large occasions for organizations around the world.
emc present &quot; heaten sie transparenz welcome &quot;
A lot of thanks to you.
nun, morgan, im name der transparenz dies: what is now exactly with the $7100 passed?
This is a great phrase.
I have in my pocket a cheque, issued to the overorganisation of the ted-organisation, the sapling-stiftung -- a cheque in the height of $7100, to finance my ted-presentation in the next year.
My name is What.
For 18 months I did something different at Google, and I do something different with museums and art to do. my boss, who is today, gave me green light.
It lasted 18 months.
A mix of spaßiger negotiations and stories, that I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I’m going to focus on the presentation.
There is a menge story about why we have this getan.
I think my personal sight is very simple with this film and its access explained.
I wuchs in India up.
I received a great education – I did not defend myself – but I had too many museums and no access to these works of art.
When I then travel, and visit these museums, I began to learn a menge.
And while I work for Google, I tried to bring this sehnsucht – to make art more accessible – together with technology.
We then formed a team, a great crew, and we started hiermit.
I will probably start with the demonstration, and tell them some interesting things that have passed since they started.
You can also simply go to googleartproject.com.
You can see all of these museums here.
Da is das uffizi, das moma, die hermitage, das riches, das van gogh.
I even get in one of my favourites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
You get on two ways to rein – very simple.
Click , and wumms , is man im this museum .
It doesn’t matter where they are – Bombay, Mexico, it doesn’t make any difference.
You go around and have fun.
Do you want to visit the museum?
Open the card, and jump it with a click.
Drin are they, they want bis ans ende des gangs.
Just go on, a lot of fun.
Support them.
Thanks, but the best is still coming.
Now I am also in front of one of my favourite images, erntearbeiter von Pieter Breugel in der Met.
I see this plusmark.
If the museum has given a picture, click on it.
This is one of the pictures.
Here are all metadata.
Jene of them, who are really an art interested, can click here – but I click that now away.
This is one of the images that we have held with the so-called gigapixel technology.
This image for example has approximately 10 billion picture points, I believe.
And one menge people ask me : &quot; what gets man for 10 billion picture points ? &quot;
I will show you now:
You can very easily rein and rosezoomen.
You see something funny here.
I love this guy; his expression is unnecessary.
But then they really want to deep in.
And so I fing an herum to play, and stellte fest that there’s something going on.
and I do : &quot; moment bad , das sounds interesting . &quot; &quot;
I went nah ran, and noticed slowly that these kids actually somewhat slugged.
I forschte a little, sprach with some acquaintances when met, and fand actually out, that it is about a game named squail, with them a gans am fastnachtsdienstag with a stock will be hit.
scheinbar war is quite popular.
I don't know why they're taten, but I'm learning something about it.
If you are really nak heran to go, you can go up to the rissen.
Just to give them the overview, zoome I out, so that they can see what you get.
We were here, and this is the gem.
But the best comes yet – in a second.
Let us quickly go to the moma springen, back to New York.
Another love picture of me, sternennacht.
With them the previous example went to find individualities, to find individualities.
But what if you see the pinselstriche will?
And what if you see will how Van Gogh created this masterpiece?
manomed hinein. man can really go hinein.
I will zoomen this image in one of my favourites until I really am at the rissen.
That’s a sternennacht,<unk> no one has seen it like that.
Now I will show you my favourite function.
There are many more, but I miss the time.
That’s really cool part, it’s called sammlungen.
Each of them, each – whether rich or arm, whether they have a tolles haus – does not matter.
They can loslegen and online create their own museum – out of all these images they can make their own sammlung.
Very simple, they go in – and I have created these, it means the power of zoom – they can umherzoomen.
Das ist &apos; die gesandten &apos; , in der nationalgallerie .
They can give everything with comments, send their friends, and so a conversation starts about what they feel when they look at these masterpieces.
I think, abschließend, is for me the main thing that all the wonderful things here do not come from Google.
They come meines erachtens after not bad out of the museum.
I might not have to say that.
They come from the artist.
And that was an experience in demut for me.
I mean, I hope that we will be honoured with this digital medium of art, and they will properly represent online.
This is the greatest phrase that will be put to me recently: &quot; have they done that to replicate the experience of a museum visit? &quot;
The answer to this is NO.
It should complement the experience.
I am going to do it. thank you.
Thank you .
This is a darstellung of their gehirns. their gehirn can be divided into two halves.
That is the left half, which is the logical seite, and then the right half, which is the intuitive seite.
If we had a measure to measure the aptitute of each hemisphere, we could be able to represent her gehirn.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is completely intuitive.
Now, where would they position their gehirn on this maßstab?
Some of us may have chosen one of these extreme, but I think that, for most people in the public, their gehirn looks like that—with a high aptitute, which is simultaneously in both hemispheres.
It’s not as if they’re both exclusive or similar.
They can be logical and intuitive.
And so I see myself as one of the people, together with the most other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good anteil logic to combine the complex ideas together.
But at the same time we need a good anteil intuition to actually carry out the experiments.
How do we develop this intuition? now, we love to play with things.
We also go out and play with it and then see how it reacts. and then we begin to develop our intuition there.
In the ground they do the same.
So one of the intuitions that they have developed over the jahre is likely that a thing to the same time can only be in one place.
I mean, it can seltsam clingen about nachzudenken that a ding zur gleichen zeit an two different orten is, but they were not born with this idea, they have developed it.
I remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle.
is still a little boy and not very good darin and is faithful constantly hin.
But I wette that playing with the bodenschwelle teaches him a very valuable lesson, that is, the great things don’t let you just pass, and that they stay on one star.
And das is a great conceptual model of the world, as long as they are not a partchenphysicist.
It would be a horrible model for a partchenphysicist because they don’t play with bodenschwellen, but with these small seltsamen partchen.
And when they play with their share, they place all possible bizarre things together—such as that they are directly through the mauern fliegen, or that they can be at the same time on two different ortens.
And so they wrote all these observations, and called them the theory of quantum mechanics.
Das war der stand der physik vor einigen jahren; man needed quantum mechanics um die kleine, winzigen teilchen to describe.
But you didn’t need them to describe the great everyday objects um uns herum.
That has not liked my intuition and that may only be because I don’t play so often with partchen.
I play with them sometimes, but not very often.
And I haven’t seen her yet.
I mean, no one has ever seen a parcel.
But my logical seite has not liked it either.
For if all things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist and all these things exist.
I don’t know why it shouldn’t be so.
I would also feel significantly better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that alltagsgegenstände also den regeln der quantenmechanik folgen.
So I made myself before a couple of jahren about it, exactly that to tun.
I made one.
This is the first object that you can see, that is in the quantum mechanical superposition war.
Was us here also see is a winziger computer chip.
And you can’t see this green point there in there.
That’s the piece of metal about which I’m going to talk.
This is a picture of the objects.
I’m looking at it here, we’re looking at it here, we’re looking at it here, we’re looking at it here.
And here is a really very large capture of this small piece of metal.
Was we also look is a small piece of metal it is like a sprungbrett geformt and it stands over the side over.
I also made this ding on similar ways on which man makes a computer chip .
I went a clean room with new siliziumscheiben, and rackerte for 100 hours an all the big geräten.
for the last little I had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool geformte loch and the ding.
This ding has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition but it needs a little help um it to tun.
Let me give you an analogy.
Do you know how unpleasant it is to be in a full lift?
I mean, if I am alone im upzug bin, then I do all possible seltsamen things but then the other people stige and I hear on all these things to do, because I do not bother them with it will, or, openly, they scratch.
Quantum Mechanics also says that unbehavioral objects feel the same.
The contributors for unbehavioral objects are not only humans, but also the light, which shines on them, and the wind, which shines on them, and the hitze of the spaces.
And so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behaves quantum-mechanically, we had to shrink all the companions out.
And then we get it.
We have the light turned off, legten it in a vacuum and saved the whole air out and cool it up to fast to now, all alone im upzug, was the piece of metal free, to behave as always it wanted.
So we have gemessened his movement.
Wirten stellten fest that it really moves seltsam.
Instead of that it’s just quiet, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated, it’s vibrated.
In them we gave him a small shubs, we could cause it to vibrate at the same time and not to vibrate — something was only permitted in the quantum mechanics.
What I’ve just told you is also really fantastic.
What does it mean for an object to vibrate at the same time and not to vibrate?
Let us think about the atoms.
also the first fall: all the trillions of atoms from which the piece of metal consists are still there and at the same time moving diesel atoms on and ab.
Only the precise time point is the same.
The rest of the time they are delocalised.
That means that each atom is to the same time an two different ortens, which at the same time means that the whole piece of metal an two different ortens is.
I think that’s really cool.
Really really.
The mass difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is approximately the same as the difference between that piece of metal and them.
So if a single atom can be to the same time and two different ortens, this piece of metal can be to two different ortens, why not it?
I mean, that’s just what my logical site says.
So, put them in mind, they would be for the same time an multiple orten, how would they feel?
How would your consciousness be overwhelmed by the fact that your body is delocalised in space?
There is another aspect in history.
When we are warmed, the light accalted and the box reinschauten, we see that the piece of metal is always in a piece of da war.
And so I had to develop this new intuition that it looks like if all the objects are in reality only quantities of objects that are made together in a small space.
They hear a menge gerede about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected with everything.
Now, that’s not quite right;
It’s still deeper, it’s still deeper.
It is so that these connections, their connections with all the things about herum, literally define who they are, and that is the tiefsinnige and seltsame of quantum mechanics.
A lot of thanks.
In 2007 I decided that we should re-conceptualize as we think about economic development.
It should be our soul that, when families think about where they want to live and work, they are given the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities, all of which are in competition with a new habitant.
At the moment we are far away from this soul.
There are billions of people in developing countries, not even a single city available to them, which they would welcome.
But the amazing city is that they are so much more valuable than it costs them to build.
We could the world also very easily with duzenden,<unk> even hundreds of new cities equipped.
That sounds now<unk> absurd for you, unless you have not yet thought of new cities.
They just change the smell of houses against the smell of cities out.
The half of the people who want to live in houses are already doing this, but the other half is not yet.
They could try to expand the capacity of the already existing houses.
But they know what they are going to do, in these houses and in their surroundings, the lord will be able to avoid complaints, and we will be able to cultivate abzulenken.
It is also very difficult to find out all of these extensions.
But man could go an entirely new ort, a entirely new wohnblock bauen, provided that the gesetze there would support a solchen smell and not obstruct it.
I have also proposed that governments create new flags that provide enough space for a city, and I have given them a name: charter cities.
Later I found out that, about the same time, Javier and Octavio thought about the challenge of a reform in Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 Honduraners left their land, and they wanted to know what they could do, to make sure that these people can stay in their land and get the same thing in Honduras.
an this star has javier zu octavio said, &quot; was passert, if we take an uninhabited flags of our landes- was, if we simply give them a mission- a part of the American mission; a part of the Canadian mission- and if the people then want to work under the Canadian rules or those of the United States, they can work there, and can on the flags of these missions do everything, what should they normally go to Canada or America? &quot;
In the summer of 2009 a little Honduras under a severe constitutional crisis.
At the next plannemess wahlen, wann pepe lobo in a umschwung, whose program is both neuerungen and schlichtung promised.
He forced Octavio to become his stable boss.
In the meantime, I will prepare myself for a vortrag at tedglobal vor.
Through verbesserung, testing, and by the investigation of consumers, I have tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to the essential elements.
The first point, is the importance of geset, gesetze, the bestimmen, that you must not disturb the already existing housing owner.
We give new technologies great attention, but for the advanced needs it is technology and gestures. and it is for the usual gestures that keep us back.
im herbst 2010 schickte a friend from Guatemala octavio den link zu dem tedtalk .
He once again showed him Javier.
The two rushed to me.
and sagten, &quot; let us present the presidents of our lands! &quot;
also find us in December in the sitzungssaal of a hotel in Miami .
I have tried to clarify how valuable cities are, how valuable they are as much as they cost.
And I have used this graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like New York. remember that a flake in some falls per square meter is worth a thousand of dollars.
but it was a quite abstract discussion, an an a star as it is a break gab, has octavio said, &quot; Paul, we could uns<unk> the tedtalk look. &quot;
Der tedtalk stellte also in a much simpler form, but that a charter city is a place, whose extent is unbewohntes land, a founding agreement, in which the gesetze festlegt, that there lords and the man who offers the possibility to decide whether to live under these rules or not.
Therefore, I was asked by the president of Honduras, who said that we must realize this project, that it is important, and that this is the way to bring our country forward.
I was asked to come after tegucigalpa and again on the fourth and fifth of January to keep a prescription.
So I’ve kept another plot filled with facts, which has a graph like this, which tries to reveal that if you create a lot of value will in a city, it must be a very large city.
Das is a picture of the city of Denver, and the sketch poses the new airport Dar, which was built in Denver.
Only this airport has a plate of 100 square kilometers.
I have also tried to convince the Honduraner of that, if you want to build a new city, you have to start with a range of at least 1,000 square kilometers.
This is more than 250 thousand tomorrow.
They have all applauded.
The faces of the spectators were very serious and attentive.
der leiter des congresses kam on the stage and has said, &quot; professor romer, I thank them gently for their vortrag, but could we<unk> den tedtalk look.
I have it here on my laptop. &quot;
I have also hinged myself, and they have den tedtalk abgespielt.
And I came to the heart of the fact that a new city offers new opportunities to mankind.
There is the possibility to live in a city that would be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of kilometers away in the north.
And a new city also encompasses new opportunities for leadership.
The leaders of the government in Honduras would be dependent on the aid from the partner countries, they could benefit from their partner countries, which they would support in them setting the statute for this Charter and in its implementation, that everyone can trust that the Charter will be truly enforced.
And the recognition of President Lobo, was that the certainty of the persecution over which I have thought as a way to bring foreign investors to emerge and to build this city could be equal to all the parties in Honduras, who have suffered for many years under fear and misconfidence.
We are in a row area.
This image is from this place.
Es fasst mühelos a thousand square kilometers.
On the 19th of January, they voted for an amendment to the Constitution, in order to have a constitutional regulation that is permissible for special development areas.
In a country that has just a severe crisis behind it, the congress was elected for this constitutional amendment with 124 for one vote.
All the parties, all the factions of society, supported this.
In order to become part of the Constitution, it must be approved twice by the Congress.
On February 17th, it was approved for the second time with 114 to a vote.
Immediately after this wahl, between the 21st and the 24th of February, a delegation of approximately 30 hunduranern travelled to the two orte of the world, who were most interested in it, to establish the business of the city building.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a large, new stadtzentrum, which in South Korea was built – bigger than the stadtzentrum of the resorts.
All that you can see on this image was built within four jahren erbaut, after it was four jahre gedauert hat, which genemigungen to receive.
Der andere ort , der sehr am städtebau interessiert war , is Singapore .
There have already been two cities in China erbaut and the third is in preparation.
If you also practically see thinking about it, it is that where we stand today.
They already have a baugrund; and they are already considering this plate for the second city.
It is already working on a law system that the manager allows to participate, and it is also working on an external law system.
A land has already offered to put its supreme court at its disposal, as a court for the entgültige berufung des dortigen judiciaire systems.
Also städtdesigner and -bauer are very interested.
They even bring funding with them.
One thing, as you already know, has already been clarified, there are many meters.
There are many betriebes who would like to be ansiedeln in America, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are many people who would like to live there.
There are 700 million people around the world who say they want to live permanently in another place.
A million people leave Latin America annually and wanders into the United States.
Many of them are wheaters who are forced to leave their families back to seek work—sometimes they are single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat and wear.
Unfortunately, they are sometimes even children who try to find their ancestors again, which they, in some cases, have not seen since a decade.
What is it so for an idea to think about it in Honduras to build a completely new city?
Or even a dozen of these cities are to be built, or hundreds of these cities are spread throughout the world?
What is it also for an idea to rely on that each family has a wahl between several cities, which are in competition with new inhabitants?
This is an idea that is worth spreading.
My friends from Honduras have asked me to say, thank you Ted.
Do you know how many decisions you make on a typical tag?
Do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week?
I have recently done a survey with over 2,000 Americans and the average number of decisions that according to a typical Americans on a tag power is 70.
Zudem was recently conducted a study with ceos, in which she a woche lang the ceos beobachteten.
And these scientists have simply documented the different topics with which this CEO has dealt with. and how much time they spent with it to make decisions that are related to the topic.
And they have found out that an average CEO is busy in the woche with 139 tasks.
Each of these themes consists of many, many smaller decisions, of course.
50 percent of their decisions were taken within nine minutes or less.
Only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own decisions.
Do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes category compared to those in the one hour category?
How well, do you think, are you in the process of making those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time, the decision-making overlasting problem.
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
Now, if I speak about this problem, I will ask you a few questions and I want to know your answers.
If I give them a frage, lift them up, because I’m blind, only the hand, if they want to burn a few calories.
Ansonsten, please, if I give you a question, and your answer is, also, my first question for today: are you willing to hear something about the decision-making overlasting problem?
A lot of thanks.
When I was a graduate student at the Stanford University war, I went to this very very exclusive livensmittelladen; at least damals war is really exclusive.
Es war ein Laden, der Draeger &apos;s hieß.
This business, it was fast as a vergnügungpark.
They had 250 different species of senf and essig and over 500 different species of obst and gem and more than two dozen different species of an wasser — and that was to a time when we still actually had leitungswasser gdrunken.
I loved to go to this business; but at a moment I asked myself, well, how does it come that you don’t buy anything?
Here is the olive oil gang.
They had over 75 different varieties of olive oil, including those that were included in the castle, which were from a thousand years old olive trees.
I also decided to visit one tages the filialleiter, and I fragte the leiter, &quot; this model works, that they the men all these possibilities really offer? &quot;
And er showed on the busladings of tourists who each tag kamen and usually had their cameras with them.
We decided to undertake an experiment and we chose the marmelade for our experiment.
Here is their marmelade gang.
They had 348 different species of marmelade.
We have a small restaurant set directly am eingang des<unk>.
We have there six different flavours of marmelade or 24 different flavours of marmelade hingested, and we have uns two pieces angschaut: erstens, I which fall would more people stand and try marmelade?
There are more people standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing standing
And then we see ourselves an in which case the men rather a glass of marmelade coffee.
Now we see the reversed effect.
From the men who stood standing as it was 24, they bought only three percent actually a glass of marmelade.
Von den menschen, who stood standing as it was six, now, now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of marmelade.
Now, if they calculate, they bought the men six times more than a glass of marmelade, who they had six for the election, than if they had 24 for the election.
Now, to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us — at least it is good for our size — but it turns out that the decision-making problem affects us even in very consistent decisions.
We decide not to decide, even if it is against our own best interests.
Also for the theme of the tags: financial savings.
I will now describe them a study that I conducted with gur huberman, emir kamenica, wei jang, in which we uns the decisions to sparplänen for the interest of<unk> one million Americans of approximately 650 plans in the entire United States ansahen.
and was we uns ansahen, was if the number of fund offers that were possible for a rate-saving plan, the 401 plan, the likelihood of influencing, if more for tomorrow will be saved.
And we found out that there was in der Tat a connection.
So in these plänen, we had about 657 plänen die den menschen somewhat between two to 59 different funds anboten.
and was we outfanden, war that there were more funds offered that, in der tat, the participation rate was less war.
If they now look at the extreme, the plans, the two funds proposed, had a partnahmerate in the siebzigern — still not as high as we want it.
In the plänen, the fast 60 funds anboten, the fiel the partnahmerate now on approximately the sixtieth percentage.
Now it turns out that even if they entschliessen to participate, if more options to choose stand, even then, it has a negative consequence.
Thus, the people who decided to take part tended to the fact that the more opportunities they had, the more they avoided choosing shares and funds.
The more possibilities are available to them, the more they steck their whole money in reine money market accounts.
None of these extreme decisions belong to the decisions that anyone of men would recommend if their future financial well-being is important to us.
Now, in the last ten years, we have observed three essential negative consequences in mankind, which the offer of more and more choices brings with us.
They dismiss the decision — they dismiss it, even if it is against their own best interests.
They are more likely to make worse decisions — worse financial and worse medical decisions.
They are more likely to choose things that make themselves less satisfied, even if they do it objectively better.
der hauptgrund hierfür is that we may be geniessen uns these riesigen regale voller mayonaise, senf, essig and marmelade anzusehen, but we actually can not the vergleiche and abgrenzungen ziehen and then actually can choose something out of the fantastic offer.
I would like to suggest them today are four simple technicians — technicians, which we have tested on different types and different types of research — which they can simply apply in their business.
First and foremost: limitation.
They’ve heard it bad before, but it wasn’t more true than today, that less is more.
The men are always beunruhigt when I sage, &quot; limit . &quot;
They’re always worried that they’re losing their gifts.
But in truth, we see it more and more that if they are willing to limit themselves, and the unimportant equal possibilities will be lost, now, then there is an antieg of the sales numbers, there will be the costs cut, &amp; amp; and there is an improvement of the decision-making perception.
As the proctor and gamble that different head and shoulders are reduced from 26 to 15, they experienced an anstieg of sales of about 10 percent.
As the golden cat corporation her 10 am the worst sold katzenstreus loswurde, she experienced that the winning about 87 percent anstiegen -- a ergebnis of both, they anstieg the sales numbers and the reduction of costs.
They know, the average supermakrt today, offers them 45,000 products.
A typical Walmart offers them today 100,000 products an .
But the ninth-largest supermarket, the ninth-largest supermarket of the world is aldi, and they offer them only 1,400 products — an art of tomato sauce in dosen.
nun in der Welt des Sparens, I believe one of the best<unk> that have recently come to the market, about how the best man manages the choices, was something, at them David Laibson very strongly mitgestalted, it is a program that is offered at Harvard.
Each individual Harvard angestellte is now automatically participating in a life-time fund.
Those who really want to meet a selection will be offered 20 funds, not 300 or more funds.
They know how these people often say, &quot; I don't know how I should limit it.
It’s all important possibilities. &quot;
And the first was I the angestellten question is, and tell me how the possibilities differ from each other.
And if their angestellten can’t keep them apart, they can’t be their customer either. &quot;
Now, before we started this midday, I had a conversation with Gary.
And Gary said that he would be ready to offer all the people in this audience a all-inclusive free holiday to the most beautiful street in the world.
Here is a description of the street.
I would like to read them to you.
And now I give them a few seconds to read them and then I ask them to clatschen if they are ready to gary &apos;s angebot anzunehmen.
Everyone is ready, Gary &apos;s angebot anzunehmen.
Are they all?
Let me show you a little more of it.
You knew it was a trick, isn’t it?
Now, who is ready for this trip.
I think, I may have heard more hands.
Well well.
Tatsache is, that they are objectively considered, at the first time they had more informationen than at the second time, but I would be wagen to rat that they are at the second time realer empfanden.
Because the images leessen it is for them more real.
What brings me to the second technique, which helps them to deal with the problem of decision-making overlasting, is the concretization.
It is about that, in order to understand the differences between possibilities, people must understand which consequences are associated with the individual possibilities, and that these consequences must be felt vividly and concrete.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ec card or a credit card than when they use a bargeld?
Because we don’t feel the real money.
And it turns out that if you make it that something feels concrete, it is a very good tool to bring people to save more.
So we have in a study that I have done with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero, we have done a study with the men at ing -- angestellten who have all worked for ing -- and these men were all in an assembly in which they have registered their participation for their rent savings plan.
And during this assembly, we have belassen this assembly exactly as it was always, but we have added a minority.
The smallness that we have attached was that we have asked the people to simply think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money.
In them we this simple thing taten, there was a anstieg of participation about 20 percent and there was a anstieg of the number of people who were willing to save or a anstieg about four percent at the betrag, that they were willing for the spar account to zahlen.
The third technique: categorization.
We can better deal with more categories than with more choices.
Here is for example, a study that we have done in a magazine.
It turns out that it is in the wegmans supermarkets up and down in the northern region, varies the number between 331 different species of journals to up to 664 journals has.
But do you know what?
If I show them 600 newspapers and divide them into 10 categories, or if I show them 400 newspapers, and divide them into 20 categories, then they believe that I have given them more selection and a better selection experience than I would have given them the 400 compared to them if I had given them the 600.
For these categories tell me how I can keep them apart.
There are two different juveniles here.
One is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing &quot; .
If they think that the link anzeige is swing and the right anzeige is jazz, then clatschen them into the hand.
Well, there are a couple.
If you think that the left side is jazz and the right side is swing, then please clatschen them.
Okay, a few more.
Now it turns out that you are right.
The one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, but you know she was?
This is a high degree unnützes categorization scheme.
The categories need to say something to those who choose, not to those who offer the choice.
And this problem they see often when they look at the langen listen all of these funds.
Who do you want to inform you about it?
My fourth technique: a prerequisite for complexity.
It turns out that we can deal with more information than we think, we just need to simplify it.
We need to slowly steigern the complexity.
I will show you an example of what I mean.
Let us make a very, very complicated decision: the purchase of a car.
Here is a German car manufacturer, who offers them the possibility to completely configure their car themselves.
They need to make 62 different decisions to fully design their car.
Now these decisions differ in the number of choice options they offer for a decision.
autofarben, außenfarbe des autos -- I have 56 options.
Motor, getriebe – four possibilities.
What I do now is, I am changing the order in which the decisions appear.
The half of the customers go will be from the many possibilities, 56 autofarben to the smaller possibilities, four getriebe.
The other half of the customer goes from the smaller possibilities, four getriebe, to the 56 autofarben, many possibilities.
What do I hide?
How interested you are.
If they are constantly using the standard choice in the decision, that means that they are overwhelmed, that heisste, that I lose them.
What they find out is that the people who are from the many to the smaller elections can always and again choose the standard elections.
We will lose her.
You go out of the little choices to the many, then you stay there.
It is the same number of possibilities.
The only thing that I get has is the order to be changed in which this information is presented.
When I simply attack them, I learn how I choose.
Even though the getriebe is selected, nothing about my preference is said to me, it is still ready for me to be selected.
I am also enthusiastic about the great product I bring together, and so I am willing to be motivated to be there with an interest.
Let me gather together.
I have told them of four technicians, who will milden the problem of decision-making overlasting -- limit -- they will be the overnecessary alternatives los; concrete -- make them real; categorize -- we can better deal with more categories, less possibilities; prepare for complexity.
Each of these techniques, which I describe to them today, is intended to help them manage the possibilities — good for them, they can use them for themselves, good for the people to whom they offer service.
Because I believe that the key to the best choice is that you are elective when choosing.
And the more we are elective when choosing, the better we will be in the low, the art of decision-making to practice.
A lot of thanks.
Hi . i bin kevin allocca , trends-manager at youtube . beruflich schaue i mir youtube-videos an .
That is stimulus.
Today we want to talk about how videos become viral, and then, why that’s important at all.
We all want stars to be - famous, singer, comedians - as I jung war, schien das so unendlich difficult.
But webvideos have enabled us to become all or all of our creative activities wahnsinnig famous in a part of the culture of our world.
Each of you could be famous through the internet until the next samstag.
But on YouTube, more than 48 hours of video per minute are uploaded.
Of this again will only be a winziger percentage jemals viral and will be a thousand male angeschaut and so to the cultural moment.
How does it also work?
Three things: tastemaker, partnahmecommunities and das unerwartete.
So we want to be bad.
Oh my God, oh my God.
Oh my God!
Wow wow!
Ohhhhh, wowwww !
letztes jahr sendete bear vasquez this video, das er vor seinem haus im yosemite nationalpark gefilmt had.
2010 war is 23 millionen mal angeschaut.
This graph shows how it looks like when the video last summer for the first time became popular.
Indeed, the bear didn’t want to make viral videos.
He just wanted to share a regenbogen.
Man Yosemite is known as the Yosemite Mountain Bear.
He had all the natural videos uploaded.
And this video was actually broadcast in January.
What has happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel is Jimmy Kimmel.
jimmy kimmel sendete den tweet , der das video last endes so popular machte .
Because tastemaker like Jimmy Kimmel puts up some new and interesting things and shows them to a large audience.
it &apos;s Friday , Friday . gotta get down on Friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . Friday , Friday . gettin &apos; down on Friday . you would not have thought that we would conduct this conversation without talking about this video , hopefully I .
rebecca blacks &quot; Friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos des jahres .
This year, it was<unk> 200 million mal angeschaut.
That’s how the graphic looks out.
Just like bei &quot; double rainbow &quot; seems it is out of the nothing came to be .
What is happening on that day?
It was a free day, it was a free day.
If you &apos;s want to know: these other spits are also freitage.
But what about this tag, this particular Friday?
nun, tosh.0 gabelte is on, many blogs fingen an, to write about it.
Michael J. Nelson from the mystery science theater war was one of the first, who on Twitter made a witz about it.
It is important that a single person or group of tastemakers share a point of view with a large audience and thus accelerated the process.
Then you will form this community of people who shared this great insiderwitz, and begin to talk about it, and thus to play with it.
Now there are 10,000 parodies from &quot; Friday &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven tagen had there was a parody for one individual wochentag.
Unlike the unilateral conversation of the 20th century, the participation of the community is our way to become a part of this phenomenon – either by spreading it or by making something new from it.
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
That’s, it’s very simple.
This year, it was almost 50 million mal angeschaut.
And if you think it’s crazy, you should know that there’s a dreistunden version of it, which has been viewed four million times.
Even Katzen looks at this video an.
Katzen looks at Katzen an who looks at this video.
It is important that the creativity, which is in the internet culture of the techies and geeks herrscht.
It is a remixe.
Someone made an altmodic version of it.
And then it became international.
A whole remix-community schoss out of the boden, which is from a dummen witz to something made, in them we all can participate.
Today we don’t just find genuss an something, we do mit.
Who could have predicted it all?
Who would have &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat &quot; voraussagen could ?
Which drehbücher would you be able to write in which sowas drinsteht?
In a world in which every minute 2 take video material is uploaded, only truly unique and unerwartetes can stand out like the mentioned videos.
I give zu, I was not extremely interested, when a friend told me, I solle me this great video view, about a guy, who is in New York against punished for fahrräder protested.
I bekam I a punishment because I am not on the radweg dangers bin, but often there are obstacles that allow one not decent to drive on the radweg.
da das totally surraschend and humorvoll war , was casey niestats witzige idea and his argument 5 millionen mal angeschaut .
This approach applies to everything new, what we creative tun.
And that all leads us to a big question...
What does that mean?
Ohhhh .
What does that mean?
tastemaker, creative participantgemeinden, completely unerwartetes, are the signs of a new art of media and culture, to which everyone has access and in which the public has popularity determined.
As I said, one of the current biggest stars – Justin Bieber – made his start on YouTube.
No one has to give Euren ideen greenes light.
And today we all feel like we are the owners of our pop culture.
And these are not the signs of the old media, and they hardly encounter the media of today, but they will be the discourse of the future.
A lot of thanks.
How can I talk in ten minutes about the connectivity between women over three generations, and how the amazing strength of this connectivity manifested itself in the life of a four-year-old girl, when she was over 30 years old with her little sister, her mother and her grandmother five days ago and saw long together in a small boat in the Chinese more saß. a connectivity that in the life of this little girl celebrated and no longer disappeared – this little girl, which now lives in San Francisco and speaks before them today?
The story is not yet over.
It’s a puzzle that’s still being combined.
I want to tell you about some of the puzzlestückchen.
The first piece is a man who burns his work of life.
He is a poet, a writer, a man whose whole life has been kept together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his homeland.
They keep him at the march of the Communists in Saigon vor Augen, as he must admit that his life was a single waste.
The words, so long his friends, spotteten now his.
He went back in the quiet.
It is a starv, broken by the history.
He is my grandfather.
I didn’t know him personally.
But our lives are so much more than our memories.
My grandmother did not let me forget her life.
I had to worry that it wasn’t umsonst, and it was my task, to learn that the story hardly tried to destroy us, but we overcome it.
The next puzzletil shows how a boot im early morgenrot leise on it outsources.
My mother was 18 years old, when your father died – already in an arranged marriage, already with two little girls.
For her, the life had put her a task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was completely excluded that she could fail.
After a four-year-old and film-reifen saga glitt a boot still on the see, as a fischerboot getarnt.
All adults were aware of the risks.
The greatest fear they had for pirates, rape and death.
As the most adults on the boot trug my mother a small giftflasche with themselves.
In a prison, my sister and I would first drink it, then she and my grandmother would drink it.
My first memories are from this boot – das stetige tuckern des motors, das klatschen a one welle on the bug, der weite und leere horizon.
I remember I don't remember the pirates, who many male kamen, but from the todesmut of the men on our boat lie out, or an outfall of the motors, who six hours did not want to start.
But I remember an the lichter of the beer platform in front of the Malaysian coast, and an the young man, who collapsed and died, the end of the journey was too much for him, and an the taste of the first apples, which gave me one of the men on the platform.
No apple has ever again so tasteful.
After three months in a flying camp, we landed in Melbourne.
And the next puzzlestück is about four women in three generations, who together build a new life.
We lie uns in footscray nieder, a forort inhabited by the working class, whose population consists of immigrants.
Unlike in the alteingesessenen mittelklassevororten, whose existence is me completely unknown war, gab es in footscray no anspruchsdenken.
The Gerüche aus den Ladentüren kamen aus dem Rest der Welt.
And the fetzen broken English were exchanged among men who had one thing in common: they fingen neu an.
My mother works on farmen, then on a fließband in an autofabric, six tails, double layers.
It’s hard for her to somehow find the time to get English and it-qualifications to acquire.
We were arm.
Every dollar was allocated and was in further education for English and math gestated, no matter what we for it abandoned muststen. mostly were the new things, which kamen always out of the second hand.
Two pair of strümpfe for the school, each, to the locher in the other to verdecken.
A schuluniform up to the knöcheln, because she had to be six years rich.
And there were the selten but schmerzhaften chöre von &quot; schlitzauge &quot; and here and da wandmalereien : &quot; asiaten , goes to house . &quot;
How to go home?
Something is hidden in me.
There was a meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice said: &quot; I will say out of them to go away. &quot;
My mother, my sister and I sleep in my own bett.
My mother was every night exhausted, but we told each other of our tag, and heard the movements of our grandmother im haus to.
My mother a little an alpträumen vom boot.
And it was my task, to stay awake every night, until their dreams came, so that I could wake them up.
She opened a computer business, then made a cosmetic training and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men, who did not ertruge the change, wütend and unflexible, and sorgenerfüllte kids, captured between two worlds.
Darlehen and sponsors were sought.
The centers have been built.
I live in parallelwelten.
In a war I the classical Asian student, who puts unbeatable demands on himself.
In other words, I was in unsecure life, the tragic narben der gewalt trugen, the drug abuse and the isolation.
But so many arhieled over the jahre help.
And because of this help, in my last jahr des jurastudiums I was outselected as a young Australier des jahres.
And I was catapulted by a puzzlestück to the next, and the rings passed not together.
tan le, anonymous bewohnerin von footscray, war nun tan le, flüchtling and social activist, who was invited to vorträgen an orte, of which she had not heard, and in behausungen, whose existence she could not have imagined.
I was not familiar with the label.
I didn’t know how man the besteck was used.
I didn’t know how to talk about wine.
I didn’t know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to return to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown vorort – a grandmother, a mother, and two murderers, who one of their take so completed as for twenty years ago, by telling each other the stories of their tags, telling each other, telling each other, telling each other, telling each other, telling each other.
I said to my mother, I<unk>’t do it.
She reminded me that I was now as old as she damals, when we had the boot bestiegen.
No war was not an opportunity.
&quot; you’re simply &quot;, she said. &quot; and know not, what you don’t be. &quot;
I also talked about youth unemployment and education, and the negligence of the marginalized and enthusiastic.
And if offener I sprach, the more I should tell.
I traf leute in all lives, so many of them taten das, what they love, lebten in the boundaries of the possible.
And although I had my graduation, I realized that I couldn’t find myself with a career in jury.
There had to be another puzzles.
And I realized at the same time that it’s okay to be an outsider, a neuankömmling, neu im bild – and not only okay, but something, wofür man must be grateful,<unk> a gift of the boots.
Because dazuzugehören can so easily lead to the collapse of the horizon, it can so easily mean that man accepts the annahmen of the environment.
I am nun genügend out of my bequemlichkeitsbereich gone to know that, I, the world breaks, but not so, how man is afraid.
Opportunities that were not allowed were explicitly encouraged.
There was an energy, an untouchable optimism, a seltsame mixture of demut and wagnisses.
So I follow my bauchge feeling.
I sammelte a small team of leuten um me , for which the schublade &quot; goes not &quot; a unwiderstehliche challenge darstellte .
A year long we didn’t have a cent.
I am still one one tags I liked a giant topf soup , den we uns share .
We worked until late in the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but there were a few brilliant, and we achieved the breakthrough.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.,
After just one trip there.
My feelings again.
Three months later, I was umgezogen and the adventure went on.
Before I den vortrag abschließe, I would like to tell you about my grandmother.
She wuchs to a time up, in the confusionism the social norm and the local mandarin the most important person was.
Life has not changed for hundreds of years.
Her father died shortly after her birth.
Her mother pulled her up alone.
At the age of 17, she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother she broke.
Without the support of her men, she saddened for a sensation, by giving him vor gericht brachte and accuserin in her own fall war, and a even greater sensation as she won.
&quot; go not &quot; erwies themselves as unwahr .
I douche just in a hotel room in sydney, as she is hungry. 1000 km away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower wall and saw them standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother called me a few minutes later.
A few days later we went into a Buddhist temple in footscray and saßen um their sarg .
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight we came to the monk and said, it must be the sarg closed.
My mother bats us, to attach her hand.
Why is her hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold?
&quot; because she has kept her since this morning &quot;, he said.
&quot; they have not losgelassen them. &quot;
If there is a band in our family, then it runs through the women.
When we see who we were, and how life has formed us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives, might have come into the desires.
The defeat would have been too simple.
Now I would like to have my own children, and I still think of the boat.
Who would ever wish for one?
I have angst for privileges, for lightness, for justification.
Can I give them a bug in their lives, the mutig every welle trotzt, the unbeirrte, the stetige tuckern des motors, the wide horizon, the nothing guaranteed?
I don’t know it.
But if I could give this and she could surely pass through, I would tun it.
In addition, tans mutter is today here in the fourth or fifth reihe.
I am here to share my photos with you.
Is it a photograph?
This is a picture that you can’t capture with your camera.
Nevertheless begann my interest in photography, when I my first digital camera erhielt, im alter von 15 jahren.
I combined it with my previous vorliebe fürs zeichnen, but it was a bit different, because when using the camera was the process much more in the planning.
And if you take a picture with a camera, the process ends when you press the outlet.
For me it seems that in the photographs it is also rather to go darum, I am the right place to be the right time.
I think everyone can do it.
So I wanted to create something else, something where the process begins when the trigger is pushed.
Photos like this : a baustelle entlang a much befahrenen street .
But it has an unexpected wendung.
And still keep a realistic ebene.
or photos like these – dark and colorful at the same time, but all with them common soul, a realistic ebene to maintain.
If I mean reality, I mean photo reality.
For, of course, she is not something that you can really capture, but I want it to always look like if she could have, on a photo.
Photos in which you have to think for a short moment, um den trick herauszufinden.
It is also more likely to take an idea, than really a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it about the details or the colors?
Is it about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
Last ends but go is darum, how we the world interpret, and how they can be made greifbar on a two-dimensional plate.
It is not what is realistic, but what we think is realistic.
I also believe that the foundations are very simple.
I see them as a puzzle of reality, with which you can take different pieces and gather together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
We have here three perfectly imaginable physical objects, with which we can all identify ourselves in a three-dimensional world.
But in a particular art combined with each other, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, as if it could exist.
But at the same time we know that this is not possible.
We overlisten also our gehirne, because our gehirn simply does not accept that it is not really sinn power.
And I see denselben process im combinieren of photos.
It is only possible to combine different realities.
The things that make a picture look realistic, I believe they are the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about, the things that we do not think about.
But when we combine photos, it’s really important to think about it, because otherwise they just look somewhat false out.
I would also say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to<unk> a realistic result.
As you can see, these are not three special pictures.
Combined but they can create something special like that here.
The first rule also says that combined photos should have a dieselbe perspective.
twoitens should have combined photos dieselbe beleuchtungsart .
And these two images meet these two requirements – from the same height shot and the same lighting art.
drittens go is darum, it is impossible to make to differentiate, where the individual images begin and end, by connecting them nahtlos.
It is impossible to say how the picture was actually composed.
indem man also color, contrast and helligkeit an den rändern den einzelne bildern angleicht, photographic game addert, like feldtiefe, entsättigte colors and disturbances, verwischen wir die grenzen between the various imagesn and let them look like a single photo, although a picture is basically hundred of ebenen can contain.
Here is another example.
You may think that this is just a landscape, and that underlying part has been manipulated.
This image is, however, in reality completely aggregated, from photos of different orten.
I personally find that it is easier to create a place than to find a place, because you do not have to compromise with the idea in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And when I had this idea in winter, I knew that I needed several months to plan the different places to find for the pieces of the puzzles.
For example, the fish was taken on an English excursion.
The ufer stammt from another ort.
Der unterwasser-part stammt from a steinbruch.
And yes, I’ve even got the house up on the island rot umgefarbt, to let it look Swedish.
In order to<unk> a realistic result, it goes out of my view also on planing out.
I always start with a sketch, an idea.
Danch is about the combination of the different images.
And here each piece is very well planned.
And if you then make good recordings, the result can be quite nice, and also quite realistic.
There are also all the tools available, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
A lot of thanks.
I would like to talk to them about why so many electronic health-projects fail.
And I think the most important point is that we have stopped talking to our patient.
And one of the things that we have introduced at the radboud-university, war, an haupt-zuhörer anzustellen.
She does not go especially scientifically – she puts a cup of coffee or tea hin and asks the patient, family, relatives, &quot; how goes &apos; s ?
How can we help you? &quot;
And we think, we want to think that this is one of the main problems, why all –<unk> just most of the electronic health-projects fail: because we have stopped listening.
This is my wlan-waage. a very simple ding.
She has a knopf, an / aus.
And one morning I’ll jump on it.
I have a task, as you may realize.
I’ve put my task at 95 kg.
It works very simple: every time I go to the waage springe, I send them my dates also an google health.
And there they will also be called by my general doctor, so that he can recognize where my weight problem lies, and not only in the moment in which I need cardiological support or so, but also with a look into the past.
But there is something else.
I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
also one morning springe I on my wlan-waage and the people speak already with me, before I im auto sitze : &quot; zum mittagessen lieber only a small salad today, lucien. &quot;
but das is das netteste, what passeren can, because dies der gruppenzwang is, gruppenzwang, to help the patient, because das could be used against fatleibigkeit, or it could be the patient that smokes abgewöhnen.
But it could also be used to bring people out of their stools, and to bring them to play some art game together, to better control their health.
Abster next week comes to the market.
It will give this small blutdruck-messgerät, that man an iphone or so connects.
And it will enable the man to measure his blood pressure from home, to send him to his doctor, and, for example, to share him with others, for a little more than $100.
They can not only take the control again, be a captain on their own ship, but they can also help us in healthcare in the face of the challenges that are in front of us, as well as the cost explosion of healthcare, double demand, and so on.
make them methods that are easy to use and catch them with this an, patient in the team to umarmen.
And that can be achieved through such methods, but also through crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we’ve done, I’d like to share with them through a video course.
We all have navigation systems in our cars.
Per<unk> even in our mobile phones.
We know exactly where all the geldautomaten um maastricht herum are located.
We still know where all the tanks are located.
And of course, we can find the fast food chain.
But where would the next AED be to help this patient?
We asked herum, and no one knew it.
No one knew where the next lebensrettende aed at this moment to find war.
We have crowdsourcing in the Netherlands.
We have a website errichted and a human mass asked, &quot; if you see a aed, please share them uns mit, where er is, when er on hat, &quot; because sometimes is er while business hours closed, of course.
And over 10,000 AEDs have already been gemelded in the Netherlands.
The next step was to find the apps for it.
And we have created an ipad app.
We have developed an app for the screen, erweiterte reality, to find these aeds.
And if they are in a city like Maastricht and someone collapses, they can use their iphone, and within the next weeks also their microsoft-handy, to find the next aed, who can save lives.
And today we want to introduce this not only as aed4u, as the product is called, but also as aed4us.
And we want to bring this to a worldwide Ebene.
And we ask our colleagues around the world, from other universities, therefore, to help us behave like node points, to make these AEDs around the world crowdsourced.
And if they are in vacation and someone collapses, whether it is their own relativity or someone else, they can find such a aed.
The other thing, what we want to ask, is that firms around the world help us in the confirmation of these aeds.
These may be courier services, or technician for example, only um ensure that the gemeldete aed is still on its star.
Please help us in doing so and try not only to improve your health, but to take it into your hand.
A lot of thanks.
Today I will report from unerwarteten discoveries.
I work in the solartechnology industry.
And my small start-up wants us to get to the environmental protection by...
Crowdsourcing beachtung schenkt.
Here is a video course about the, what we tun.
Oh, a moment.
It may take time until it is frozen.
nun – we can das simply overpringen – I will instead simply the video overpringen ...
No in no.
That’s not...
Okay okay.
Solar technology is...
Oh, my time has passed?
Okay, a lot of thanks.
So before a few years I started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a jahr out time and work in an environment that represents so much of everything, what they really hate, we have let them work in the government.
The program is called &quot; code for America &quot; and it is a bit like the friedenscorps for computerfreaks.
We choose each year some fellows out and we let them work with the city governments.
Instead of sending them to the third world, we send them in rathäuser.
And there they developed great apps, worked with urban collaborators.
But what they really tun is to show what today with technology is possible.
He also met Al.
Al is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
here looks it out, as if it is after a date sucht, but what is really sucht, is someone who freischaufelt it, if it is ineschneit, because it is white, it is not very good in the brandbekämpfung if it is from a meter snow zugedeckt.
How do you get to look for this special art for help?
we had letztes jahr a team of fellows in Boston im zuge das &quot; code for America &quot; programms .
They were there in February, and it had a lot of snow last February.
And they notice that the city is not these hydrants freely swallowing.
But a certain fellow, a man named erik michaels-ober, noticed still something different and the war that the bewohner the bürgersteige fre schaufelten, directly in front of these parts.
Also tat er, what every good developer would tun, er wrote an app.
It is a net small app, where you can adopt a hydrant.
You stimmst to him free to shoufeln when it is snow.
If you can, you can give him a name, and he called the first al.
If you can’t do it, someone can say you can take it away.
There is also a nice small game dynamics.
This is a small app.
It is probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year.
But they do something, which no other government technology does.
She breaks out rasantly.
Da is this kerl in der i.t. department der stadt honolulu, who has seen that er this app could be used, not for snow, but so that the citizens adopt tsunami-sirene.
It is very important that these tsunami-sirenes work, but the people stehlen the batteries.
So bekam is the citizen to check it out.
And then decided Seattle, the app to use to get the bourgeois to get the verstopften goldys to clean up.
and Chicago has just introduced her, so that the people the buergersteige freischaufeln, when it snow.
We know now nine cities that plan to use this app.
And she has reibungslos verbreitet, organic, of course.
If you know something about government technology, you know that it normally doesn’t work like that.
The beschaffung of software lasts usually a few years.
We had a team, that lasted a year on a project in Boston work, for the three leute two and a half months needed.
It was a method by which the parents could find out which the right public schools are for their children.
It was later told that if it would go over the normal channel, it would have lasted over two jahren and it would have cost over two million dollars.
And that’s nothing yet.
There is currently a project in the California Justice, which the steuerzahler has so far costed two billion dollars, and it doesn’t work.
And there are projects like this on every edge of the government.
Also an app, which is written in a few tags, and then by selbt ausbreitet, is an art schuss vor den bug on the institution of the government.
It shows how that government could work better—not more like a private enterprise, how many people think it should.
And not even like a tech-business, but rather like the internet itself.
and das means free access, and das means open and productive.
And that is important.
But more important in this app is that it represents a new generation, which the problem of the government anpackt—not as the problem of a broken institution, but as a problem of the collective handelns.
And that’s a very good news because it turns out that we’re very good in collective trading with digital technology.
Now there is a large community of people who produce the help, which we need to effectively pack things together.
It is not only &quot; code for America &quot; fellows, there are hundreds of people throughout the country who wake up and government-apps write, one tag in their own communities.
They did not give up the government.
They are terribly frustrated with her, but they do not complain about it, they repair her.
And these people know something that we have lost out of the eye.
And that's then, if you forget all your feelings about politics and the slange at work and all the other things, about which we really get up, is governance, in the core, in the words of tim or reilly, &quot; what we get together, that we can't get alone. &quot;
Today, a large number of people have resigned the government.
And if you are a generous man, I ask you to think about it, because things will change.
The politics are not changing; the government is im wandel.
And because the government ultimately creates its power from us -- reminds you of: &quot; we do the people? &quot; -- how we think about it, will influence how this wandel happens.
I didn’t know much about the government when I started this program.
And how many people, I thought that it is at the government mainly darum goes people in an amt to vote.
Now after two jahren, I came to the conclusion that it is especially in the municipality, about beutelratten goes.
This is the call center for service and information.
There comes you usually out when you in deiner stadt 311 call.
If you ever have the chance to have solltest, in your städtisches call-center to work, as our fellow Scott silverman as a part of the programs -- in der tat, tun sie das alle -- you will see that the people, the government because of a lot of different problems call, including that a beutelratte in their house steckt.
Scott also gets this anfruf.
er tipt &quot; beutelratte &quot; in the official datenbank .
And he doesn’t really have an idea. he gets with them tierfänger an.
and finally says er : &quot; look at them, they can simply open all the türen in their house and play very laute music and see, ob das vieh abhaut ? &quot;
Applause for Scott.
But that was not the end of the beutelratten.
Boston has not just a call center.
It has an app, a web and handy app, names &quot; citizens connect &quot;.
We haven’t written this app.
Das ist die Arbeit sehr kluger leute im büro der &quot; new urban mechanics &quot; in Boston .
One tag -- that's a real message - kam dies rein : &quot; beutelratte in my mlltonne . can't say, if she's all.
How do I get them away? &quot;
But was mit &quot; citizens connect &quot; passed is different .
Scott interfere with himself from mench to mench.
But on &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public so that everyone can see it.
And in this case, it was a neighborhood.
And the next post, den we get have lautete, &quot; I went there over, fand the mulltonne behind them haus.
Beutelratte? yes. live? do it.
Drehte die Mülltonne on the seite. went home.
Good night, sweet beutelratte. &quot;
quite simple.
Here trifft das digitale das physische.
And it is also a good example of how the government in the crowdsourcing is to get.
But it is also a great example of the government as a platform.
And I do not necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here.
I am more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
One citizen half another citizen, but the government played a central role here.
She connects these two people.
And you would have been able to connect them with state services if they were needed, but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to state services.
If one neighbor helps the other, we strengthen our communities.
We call the tierfänger, the cost is a menge of money.
One of the most important things is that we have to think about it is that government is not the same as politics.
And most people understand that but they believe that one is the input of the other.
That our contribution to the system is to choose.
How many times have we chosen a political leader—and sometimes have we spent a lot of energy to choose a new political leader—and then we lie back and we expect that the government, our values and our needs will be reflected and fulfilled, and then has not changed much?
That’s because the government is like a further ocean and the politics are the 15cm superior.
And what darunter is, is that, what we call bureaucracy.
And we use this wort with solcher contempt.
But it is this disregard, which makes this thing, which we possess, and for which we pay, something to be, which works against us, something else, and then we defeat ourselves.
The people seem to think, politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
That’s because it’s where the actual government work takes place.
We have to engage in the machinery of the government.
also the occupythesec-bewegung has it getan.
Have you seen these guys?
It is a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed 325-seitigen message, which is an answer to the sec-memo about the legislation for the financial reform.
It is not to be politically active, it is to be bureaucratically active.
Now, for those of us who have abandoned the government, it is time for us to think about the world that we want to leave our children.
You have to tell you the enormous challenges you have to face.
Do we really believe that we can<unk> what we have to<unk> without improving an institution that can trade in the name of all of us?
A government is absolutely necessary, but it must be more efficient.
The good news is that technology is possible, that the function of the government is fundamental, and that it can actually<unk> something by strengthening the society.
And there is a generation that has grown up with the internet, and that knows that it’s not so difficult to do things together, you have to just build the right systems.
nun das durchschnittsalter of our fellows is 28 , so bin I, unfortunately, fast a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with it to see its stimulus as obvious.
They do not fight this struggle, that we all fight, darum, whoever can speak, they all can speak.
They can their meinung äußern, on any channel to any time, and they tun it.
So, when they are faced with the problem of the government, do not take care of so much darum, to use their stimuli.
They use their hands.
They use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government.
And these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our community.
Das could be, a hydranten freizuschaufeln, unkraut zu jäten, a mülleimer with a beutelratte umzudrehen.
And sure, if we could have these hydrants the whole time freischaufeln, and many people tun das.
But these apps are like small digital memories that we are not just consumers, and we are not just consumers of the government, that steuern payments and licenses emphangen.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we will not improve the government until we improve the citizenship.
So the question I have for you all here: if it is about the great, important things that we must do together, all together, will we be just a mix of voices, or will we also be a mix of hands?
Thank you .
Normally, my role consists in explaining how wonderful the new technologies that I am emerging will be, and I thought, since I am here under friends, I would tell you what I really think, and also try to look back and understand what here really is going, with these incredible sprüngen forward, which are so rapidly happening that we hardly can mithalten.
I’m going to start by showing you a short, unpleasant film.
If you can, please, show the short folie.
This is a file that I have selected by chance from my order.
I am not talking about the details of the film, but rather about the general form.
This film shows the data of an analysis by us about the performance of risk processors compared to the performance of a local area network.
The interesting here is that this film, like so many others, which we often encounter in our field, is an art just on a semi-logarithmic curve.
In other words: every step here corresponds to a potence in the performance scale.
And this is a novelty that we need to use this type of scale on semi-logarithmic curve im gebiet der technology.
Something very strange happened here.
This is the most important thing I will talk about here.
Also, if you please, you can light the light again.
Just because I’m going to draw something on the paper here.
So why do we see graphene in the technique on the semi-logarithmic curve?
The reason for this is, if I would draw it on a normal curve, wo, say we, that here the jahre are, so that the zeitachse of an art, and that here is any mass of technology, which I will draw with a graph, then the graph will be albern.
They see it so out.
And that doesn’t tell us a lot.
If I now record another technology will, say we will a transport technology, then it would be on the semi-logarithmic scale very unreasonably therefore, in the form of a flachen line.
But if something like this happens here, then this changes the qualitative circumstances.
So if the transportation technology would advance as quickly as the microprocessor technology, then we could be overmorgen in a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in Tokyo.
But that doesn’t go so quickly.
Das gab es noch nie zuvor in the history of the technology-development, this art of recursive growth, through which the grossenordnung all a couple of years exponentially erhöht.
The question that I now want to ask you is, if you look at these exponential curves, you see, they don’t go forever.
It is not possible that everything will evolve forever and forever as quickly as it is now.
There are two possibilities:
Or it will be a classic s-curve like here, until something completely new, or it will be that here.
That’s about it.
Well, I am optimist, so I think something like that in the art as here will happen.
That is really so, then that means that we are here in the moment in the middle of a transition.
We are here on this line, in a transition from the previous world to a new art of world.
The question that I also want to ask, and I often ask myself, is how will this new world be?
What is this new state that the world is slowly accepting?
Because the transition seems to be very, very confusing when you are in the middle of the water.
If I was still a child, then the future was somewhere in the year 2000 and the people often spoke about what would probably happen in the year 2000.
Now we have here a conference where the people talk about the future and it is celebrated that the future is still in the year 2000 .
As far as we do, we do not go.
In other words, the future is every year about a jahr shrumpft since I am on this world.
I think the reason for this is that we realize that something is happening.
We can all feel it, we can all feel it.
And we know that it is just now no mind power to try 30 or 50 years in the future to look, because everything will be so different that a simple high-release of them what we now do simply no mind power.
I want to now talk about what that could be, this transition in which we are at the moment.
To do this, I will first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computer.
Because I believe to be able to really understand this, we have to go a step back and look at the matter on a longer time scale.
I want to see this on the time scale of the lives of the earth.
I believe that the whole image makes sense if you are divided into a few billion steps.
We also go back, and it is 2.5 billion years ago. the erde was a bigger, sterile stone clumps with many chemicals that flush on it.
If you are now the art and weise considering how these chemicals were organized, then give us a pretty good picture of how they are anstellten.
I also believe there are theories that begin to understand how everything with rna angefangen has, but I will tell you a simplified story of what it is, that at this time small öltröpfchen herumschwebten, which different types of recipes for chemicals contained.
Some of these oils contained a special combination of chemicals which is allowed to integrate other chemicals from aussen and thus grow.
All those who were like that, began to get awake.
These small öltröpfchen were in mind the primitiveest zellenform.
However, these oltröpfchen were not about living in the present mind, because each of them was just a small, random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it divides itself, the chemicals found in it are verteilt.
Thus, each tröpfchen was a little different.
In fact, they wuchsen the tröpfchen, which had one for the growth optimal composition had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from aussen and shared faster.
These also tend to survive longer, and they multiply in greater ausmass.
That is also just a very simple chemical form of life, but it will be more interesting if these tröpfchen learn a trick about abstraction.
On any art that we don’t even fully understand, these troops have the ability to erlearn, informationen niederzuskriben.
They have learned, the recipe of the zelle as informationen zu speichern, in a certain chemical form, which we call DNA.
In other words, they have found in this geistlosen, evolutionary art a way that allowed them to not write what they existed, so that this information could be stored and copied.
The amazing thing is that this art informationen zu speichern over the time of 2.5 billion jahren, in which it is entstanden, is equal to blieb.
In fact, there is the recipe for us, namely our genes, from the exact same code and the same written way.
Each life is using the exactly the same buchstaben and denselben code.
We are so far that we can, only for vergnügungszweck, self sache in this code to write.
And I have here 100 micrograms of a weiss powder, which I try to keep in airport far from security personnel.
darin is – what I have done is, I have this code genommen – the code consists of normalen buchstaben, which we zum symbolisieren use – and I have my visit card written on a piece of DNA and I have it 10 ^ 22 times enhanced.
So if someone wants a hundred million copies of my visit card, I have plenty for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world, and it’s exactly here.
If I really had been an egoist, then I would have written it on a virus and freed it in the room.
What is the next step?
To write the DNA was an interesting step.
And that made her happy for another billion years, and that made her happy for another billion years.
But then passed a different, very interesting step, in which the things became completely different; namely, these cells began to communicate and exchange information, so that communities of cells were created.
I don’t know if they’re already aware of it, but bacteria can actually exchange their DNA.
This is also the reason why, for example, the resistance to antibiotics increases.
Some bacteria have discovered how they can keep themselves from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria in the DNA and now we have each mix of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because these bacteria communicate with each other.
This communication permitted nun das gründen of communities, which in gewissem sinne im selben boot were; they were synergetic.
Thus, either they have survived together, or they have gone together under. that means that if a community was successful, all the individuals of the community were repeated and preferred by the evolution.
The transition stelle is now there, where these communities so nakedly gathered together that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a sign chain on the DNA.
And the next interesting phase will take approximately another billion years.
At this point, we have multi-cell communities, communities of many different types of cells, which together function as an individual organism.
In der Tat we are also such a multicellular community.
We have a lot of cells that are no longer put on ourselves.
Your hautzellen are nutzlos without herzzellen, muskelzellen, hirnzellen, and so on.
These communities also began to further develop, so that the ebene, on which the evolution took place, was no longer the individual cell, but the whole cell community, which we call organism.
The next step is now taking place within these communities.
The Zellengemeinschaften began to re-informen to abstraction.
And they developed special structures, which make nothing else than information within the organism to process.
These are the neural structures.
The nerve cells are also the information processing machine that these cell communities have built up.
They fingen an specialists to be trained within the community, special structures, which were responsible for the learning, understanding and the retention of information.
And this was the mind and the nervous system of these communities.
This gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at this time an individual – learning passed now within the time span of the life of an individual organism, rather than through this evolutionary time span.
An organism could also learn for example, a certain fruit not to eat, because it smelled badly and made him sick, that last time when it was eaten.
This could now happen within the life of a single organism, whereas hundreds of thousands of jahren were needed, because this information evolutionary had to be learned by the individual who died because of this fruit, because these information processing structures were not yet present.
The nervous system also has the evolution process with the help of these special information structures because the evolution could now take place within an individual.
It could take place within a time-learning frame.
Was danach passerte is that the individual organisms find a way to communicate with each other.
Mal as a example, the raffiniertest uns known version of this communication art is the human speech.
It’s a very surprising inheritance when you think about it.
I have here a very complicated, unordinate and confusing idea in my head.
I sit here and give im grunde genommen grunzende töne von mir, in der hoffnung so that a similarly confused idea in eurem kopf to create, which has a certain similarity with my original idea.
We also take something very complicated, wandeln es in töne um, a sequence of tönen, and thus produce something very complicated in the köpfen of others.
This allows us to function again as a single organism.
And what we have actually done, we, the humanity, is, we have begun to abstraction.
We go through the diesel stages, which multi-cell organisms have passed through – the abstraction of our methods, how we daten fest, present, process.
The invention of the speech, for example, was a small step in this direction.
telephony, computer, video band, cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we have built in our community to be able to handle this informationen.
And it connects us all together to something that is much greater, and is also able to develop faster than we have been before.
Heutzutage can also evolution in the time span of microsecond geschehen.
ihr habt also tys kleines evolutionsbeispiel seen wo er a little evolution im &quot; convolution &quot; program shown hat , directly vor euren augen .
Now we have also accelerated the time scale again.
The first steps in the history that I have told you will take a billion years per piece.
The next steps, such as the nervous system and the gehirn, take a few hundred million years.
Then the next steps, such as speech and so on, will take less than a million years.
And these next steps, such as electronics, seem to only take a few decades to take.
The process feeds itself and becomes thus, I believe, auto-catalytic is the wort for it – if something increases its change rate.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
And I believe, that’s that, what we see here in this explosion-arthenic curve.
We see the process that feeds itself.
I lebe beruflich vom bauen von computern and I know that I den mechanism, which I use for computer to bauen, could not use without the recent gemachten progress in computer technology.
My current activity consists in designing objects with solch a high complexity that it is impossible for me to design these in traditional minds.
I don’t know, what every single transistor in the connection machine makes.
It has a billion of them.
What I do instead, and what the designer of thinking machines do, is, we think of a certain abstraction level, giving this to the machine and the machine makes it something that our abilities far exceed, better and faster than we could ever do.
And it makes it partly with methods, which we do not even understand right until now.
One method which is<unk> interesting, and which I have often used in latter time, is the evolution self.
In this case, we install an evolution process in the machine, which is in the microsecond-space abläuft.
In the most extreme cases, we can create a program that develops out of random instructions.
We say, &quot; computer, generate a hundred million randomly selected sequenzen of instructions.
Füre all these randomly selected instructions out, Füre all the programs out, and wähle schlussendlich those who are closer to my predictions. &quot;
Also in other words define I first was I will.
I will sort numbern, that would be a simple example that I’ve already used for it.
Find also programs that can sort am ehesten numbers.
Of course, the chance when randomly chosen instructions is very small that they sort by random just number, so there will probably not be any of the instructions actually do this.
But one of them may with a little happiness two numbers in the right order back.
now sage I, &quot; computer, nimm now those 10 % of the sequenzen, which my predictions have come near.
Save this ab, delete the rest.
Now reproduce all übriggebliebenen, who have the numbern best sorted.
and with a method des recombinierens, analogue to the reproduction. &quot;
Nimm two programs and they produce children through the austausch of their subroutine, and the children vererben the mark of the subroutine of the two programmen.
Now I also have a new generation of programmes that are created through combinations of programmes, which are a little closer to the predicts that have come than others.
sag, &quot; please repeat this process. &quot;
You value it again.
There may be some mutations.
And try it all again with another generation.
All these generations will only take a few milliseconds.
And so I can let an evolution over millions of jahren in the computer pass within a few minutes. or in more complicated cases a few hours.
Schlussendlich erhalte I program, which can perfectly sort the number.
Those programs are so much more efficient than any program that I could have written them out of hand.
If I then look at these programs, then I can’t tell you how they work.
I tried to understand them.
It is a verworrene and merkwürdige program.
But they do the job.
I know and am very sure that they will do the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programmes who have done the job.
Because your life depends on whether you do the job properly.
I sass once in a 747 together with marvin minsky, but is a card highlighted and said, &quot; oh shau. shau dir das an.
This aircraft consists of hundreds of thousands of small-teethylene who work together to make their flight safer. &apos; makes you not more confident? &quot;
We know that a development process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated.
So we begin to rely on the computer, for a process that is strongly distinguished from the classic engineering.
It allows us to produce a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce.
And yet we don’t fully understand the possibilities of this.
We’re going to get the technique too.
We use this program now to make the computer much faster so that we are able to perform this process even faster.
There is also a backdrop.
It’s going to be faster and faster and I think that’s the reason it seems so confusing.
Because all these new technologies of today feed themselves.
We heben ab.
We are an angelangt point, which analogue is too damals, as single-cell organisms have evolved into multiple-cell organisms.
We are also the amöben and we can’t yet fully ausmachen, what to hell we here really are creating.
We are in the middle of this transition.
But I really believe that something will come after us.
I find it very high-motionful for us to say that we are the end product of evolution.
And I believe we all here are part of the creation of them whatever the next comes.
Now, the midtagessen stands ahead and I think I will hear here now, before I’m still out-elected.
My story begins exactly here in Rajasthan, vor about two jahren.
I was under them sternenhimmel in der Wüste together with sufi-singer Mukhtiar Ali.
We talk about that nothing has changed since the time of the uralten Indian epos &quot; mahabharata. &quot;
If we inde damals want to travel, we jump into a wagen and swirten over the heavens.
Now we’re doing that with the aircraft.
Damals, when the great Indian kriegerprinz arjuna durst had, nahm is a bogen, schoss in the boden and wasser trat hervor.
Now we do that with the bohrern and the machine.
We kamen zu der schlussfolgerung that magic and magic were replaced by machines.
That made me really sad.
I am a bit afraid of technology.
Es mechte me angst that I could lose the ability, the sonnenuntergang can enjoy without a camera and without tweeting an my friend.
I found that technology should make magic possible and not kill.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket.
This piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me.
She became a goldener access to a world voller pirates and verunglückter shiffe and zu bildern in my presentation.
I think it’s so bad, as if they kept us our skicken uhren and cameras of that ab to dream.
They prevented us from being inspired.
And so I begab myself into the world of technology to see how I could use it to enable magic instead of killing.
At the age of 16 I began to illustrate books.
When I saw the iPad, I saw it as a gerät to the story, that the reader can connect all over the world.
They can know how we keep it.
We can know where we are.
It brings images and text together, and animation, geräusche and touch.
The story needs more and more mind.
But what do we do with it?
I’m going to just now to khoya, an interactive ipad app.
here is stated : &quot; leg your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is stated : &quot; this box belongs to ... &quot; then I write my name .
And out of me will be a figure in that book.
hin and again falls a brief for me runter -- and the ipad knows through gps where I live -- it is right an me addressiert .
The kind in me is von solchen possibilities really enthusiastic.
I have talked a lot about magic.
I mean not the magic and the dragon, but the magic of the kindness, the ideas that we all had as children.
Glühwürmchen in a glass found I always quite exciting.
So you have to kick the iPad here and leave the glühwürmchen out.
And they lighted the way through the rest of the buch.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can steck in a single murmel.
And therefore here every book and every world will be a small murmel, which I here ziehe to the magical gerät im gerät.
And this opens a card.
Fantasy books have always had a card, but these cards were statistical.
This card grows and lights and serves to the orientation of the rest of the books.
She also shows herself in other positions des buches.
I am going to rein here.
It is also important for me to create something that is Indian but also very contemporary.
These are the apsaras here.
We’ve all heard of feen and nymphen, but how many people outside the Indians know their Indian colleagues who are apsaras?
The armen apsaras were a thousand jahre in indras kammern prison, in an old muffigen buch.
And we bring them back, in a contemporary history for children.
A story that deals with new angels, such as the environmental crisis.
To the theme of environmental crisis, a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their zimmern sit, in their computer, without rauszugehen.
But now, with mobileer technology, we can bring our children in the natural world with their technology.
In an interaction of the books man will be on a suche skilled . man must go out and with the camera of the ipads images naturer objects sammeln .
As a child I had sammlungen von stöckern, steinen, kieseln and muscheln.
Sometimes the kids don’t do it anymore.
This kindness ritual is brought back. man must go out to make a photo of a flower in a chapter and to mark it.
In another chapter, one must photograph and mark a piece of baumrinde.
So you can actually create a digital sampling of photos, which you can then post online.
a kind in London shows the picture of a fuchs and says: &quot; oh, today I have seen a fuchs. &quot;
a kind in indien says : &quot; today I have seen a affen . &quot;
Das schafft a art social netzwerk around a digital sammlung of photos, which man actually captured has.
There are a lot of ways in which magic that world and technology connect to each other.
In the next buch we plan an interaction with the man the video of the ipads used and through augmented reality an animation of the elephant sees, which appears on a pflanze vor dem haus.
In one star, the screen fills itself with a blättern.
Man must do the geräusch des winds, they wegblasen and the rest of the books read.
We all move ourselves into a world in which the naturgewalts of technology come closer and in the magic and technology can approach each other.
We use the energy of the sun.
We bring our children and ourselves closer to the natural world heran and the magic, the space and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story.
A lot of thanks.
This is really an extraordinary honor for me.
I spend the great part of my time with men in investigationshaft, prisoners or todeszellen.
I spend the great part of my time with the social weakest in the social buildings and an orten, in which there is a lot of hopelessness.
To be here, to see and to hear, how stimulant that is, has given me a lot of power.
In the short time here one thing became clear to me: Ted has an identity.
You can say things that have an influence around the world.
And sometimes, when something comes over it, it gets a meaning and power that it would not have otherwise.
I say that because I believe that identity is very important.
We have seen some fantastic presentations.
I believe that we have learned that the words of a teacher have meaning, but that the words of a committed teacher are<unk> meaningful.
As a physician, you can get better than a physician, but you can get more than a physician.
And that’s why I want to talk about the power of identity.
I have not learned in my job as a lawyer.
I learned this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a family, a traditional African-American household, dominated by a matriarchin, and this matriarchin was my grandmother.
She was a taffe, a strong woman, she had an effect.
She had the last word in every family strike.
She was also the foundation of many disputes in our family.
She was the daughter of a slave family.
Their grandparents were born in the 1840s in Virginia as a slave.
She was born around 1880 and the experience of slavery formed her world image very strong.
My grandmother was strong, but she was also loving.
When I met her as a little boy, she came up on me and tired me.
She pushed me so fast that I could hardly breathe. then she left me away.
One or two hours later, when I met her, she came to me and said, “Brian, do you still feel my upset?”
And if I said ‘no’, then fatigue me again; if I said ‘yes’, then let me rest.
She was something that made that you always wanted to be in her sight.
The only problem was that she had ten children.
My mother was the youngest of her ten children.
Sometimes, when I wanted to spend time with her, it was hard to get her attention.
My cousins liefen overall herum.
I remember, I must have been eight or nine, that I woke up one morning and went into the living room. all my cousins liefen herum.
My grandmother saß am ende des zimmers and starrte me an.
I thought it would be a game.
I looked at her and smiled, but she looked very seriously out.
That went so 15 or 20 minutes. then she stood up and came to me over her. she nahm me at the hand and said, “kom, bryan, you and I, we have to talk.”
I remember it as if it was a gestern war.
I will not forget it.
She nahm me with her outside and said, “Brian, I’ll tell you something, but you have to promise that you’re not going.”
I said, “I promised, my own.”
She said, “ehrenwort?” and I said, “yes.”
She sat down and looked at me and said, “I want you to know that I have watched you.”
She said, “I think you’re something special.”
She said, “I believe, you can do whatever you want.”
I will not forget that.
Then she said, “You just have to promise me three things, Brian.”
I said, “OK, yours.”
She said, “If you first promise to me that you will always love your mother.”
She said, “Your mother is my baby and you have to promise to me that you will always take care of her.”
I worship my mother, so I said, “Yes, my mother, that will I tun.”
Then she said, “First promise to me that you will always get the right thing, even if it’s hard to get the right thing.”
I thought after and said, “Yes, my. I promise it.”
Finally, she said, “The last thing you have to promise to me is that you will never drink alcohol.”
Now, I was nine jahre alt and so I said, “Yes, yours, I promise it.”
I wuchs on that land up, in the old, rural south, and I have a brother who is a jahr older and a jahr younger sister.
When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I got one tages my brother to the house and brought this sixpack beer with the snapped my sister and me and went with us in the wald.
We will be Albert there just as herum as otherwise as well.
Then nahm is a schluck beer and bot my sister one an, and she nahm an, and then they bot me one an.
I said, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
My brother said, “Nun mach already. today we do that, you machst yet everything else, what we do.
I had was, your sister had was. los, drink a beer.
I said, “I don’t want you to do it, I don’t want you to do it.”
My brother starrte me.
He said, “What are you saying? now drink but was.”
Then he looked in my face and said, “Oh no, do you not still get crazy because of the conversation with yours?”
I said, “What do you rescue?”
He said, “They tell everyone that they were special.”
I was a boden destroyed.
I’m going to give you something.
I should probably not tun it.
This may be publicly transmitted.
I’m 52 years old and I’m saying I haven’t drunken a tropfen alcohol.
I say it not because I believe it is tugendhaft. I say it because identity means power.
If we create the right art of identity, we can say things that they don’t believe at first.
We can get them to do things they thought they could not do.
Of course, my grandmother would say all her enkeln, she’s something special.
My grandfather war during the prohibition in prison.
My uncle is suffering from alcohol-induced diseases.
And she believed that these are the themes that we must take care of.
I’ve tried to say something about our justice system.
This land is different from vor 40 jahren.
In 1972, 300,000 people were in weekanstalten and in prison.
Today it is 2.3 million.
The United States today has the highest detention rate in the world.
Seven million people are on proof of liberation or with bedingter punishment.
In my opinion, the mass preservation has changed our world fundamentally.
In social weakness and weakness the share of the population dominates despair and hopelessness, due to these changes.
One of three male schwarzen between 18 and 30 is in haft, in prison, on proof of liberation or with bedingter punishment.
in urban communities everywhere in the land – from the angels over Philadelphia, Baltimore to Washington – are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in haft, in prison, on proof of release or with bedingter punishment.
But our system will not only be formed by the questions that have to do with the race, it will also be formed by the armut.
We have a system of justice in this country that treats them much better when they are rich and guilty as poor and innocent.
vermögen, not verschulden, influences the ergebnis.
However, it seems that we are completely satisfied with it.
A policy out of anxiety and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems.
We lost the contact.
I find it interesting.
There are a few very interesting developments.
My home state of Alabama entzieht them permanently the wahlrecht, if they are punishable.
Here and today in Alabama, 34 percent of the male black population has permanently lost their wahlrecht.
We predict that in ten years the quota of the aberration of the bourgeois honorary rights will be as high as before the adoption of the wahlright laws.
The swing is ohrenbetäubend.
I sweat the kids.
Many of my mandates are very jung.
The united states of America are the only land in the world, the dreizehnjährige children to the death in prison condemned.
In this country there is for children lifelong weekstrafen without a conditional punishment.
We already have a mixed process running.
The only country in the world.
I vertrete menchen in todeszellen.
The frage of the todesstraff is an interesting frage.
We believe, because man is so taught us, that the true question is: does a man deserve to die for one of the crimes begun by him?
This is a very sensitive phrase.
But you can also think differently about it, depending on how we see our identity.
The other apparently is not: has someone for a crime the dead deserved, but: have we deserved to kill?
I find that fascinating.
The death penalty in America is defined by irrtum.
On nine of the men we have destroyed, comes one whom we have found innocent, who is entlasted and released from the whole world.
A surprising error ratio. one of nine innocent.
I find that fascinating.
We would never let anyone fly with an aircraft, if for nine aircraft, that abheben, one abstürzt.
But somehow we can do it, some of this problem abzunabeln.
This is not our problem.
It is not our burdock.
This is not our struggle.
I am talking a lot about these questions.
I rede over race and the question, whether we have the right to kill.
And it’s exciting because I’m my schülern African-American history beibringe.
I rede over terrorism, the time against the end of the reconstruction, until the beginning of the Second World War.
We don’t really know much about it.
But for the African-Americans in this country it was a time of terror.
In many giants must have men's angst vor lynchmobs,
Or before a bomb.
It was the fear of terror, in which their life formed.
These older men come to me now and say, “Mr. Stevenson, they speak, they keep the speeches, they say to the people that they should stop saying that we have to deal with terrorism for the first time in the history of our nation: after the 11th of September.”
They say, “No,” they say to the man, that we have grown up with it.
And after them terrorism came, of course, the racist separation and the jahrzehnte of racist-motivated submission and apartheid.
And yet there is in our country a dynamic ... we don't like to talk about our problems .
We don’t like to talk about our history.
And that’s why we don’t really understand what importance our taten in the historical context have.
We are constantly facing each other.
We always create new tensions and conflicts.
It falls us hard to talk about race, and I believe, that is because we are not willens to approach the process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, the people have understood that the racist division cannot be overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation.
Even after the völkermord in Rwanda there was this prejudice, but not in this our land.
I have held a few speeches in Germany about the todesstraff.
It was fascinating, for one of the scientists stood up after my proposal and said, “Wet them, it is zutiefst verstörend, they so speak to hear.”
He said: “In Germany there is no todesstraff.
And of course, it can no longer be in Germany.”
Then one woman said, “With our history it is impossible that we ever again speak for the systematic murder of men.
It would be unconscious of us, consciously and objectively human.”
I thought about it after.
How it would feel, in a world to live, in which the German state menchen hinrichten ließ, especially if darunter disproportionately many Jews were.
It would be irresistible.
It would be unconscious.
And yet, here in this land, in the state of the old south, richten we men hin – here is the risk, to be condemned, eleven times higher, when the victim is white, than when it is black.22 times higher, when the accused is black, and the victim is white – in denselben bundesstaaten, in whose land the bodies of the lighter men rest.
And yet there is that mental abkopplung.
I believe, our identity is bedroht.
If we do not deal with this, with these difficult themes, then the positive and wonderful things are also affected.
We love innovation.
We love technology and creativity.
We love entertainment.
But ultimately, these realities are overestimated by leid, abuse, herabsetting, outsourcing.
Mir erscheint is important, both to unite.
Because we speak ultimately about the fact that we need more hope, more commitment, more devotion, to be able to exist in a complex world.
For me it means the time to open up, to think, and to talk about the armen, the disadvantaged, the ones, who will never be with them.
But we think of an art and wisdom that is integrated into our own lives.
We all have to believe the last ends of things that we cannot see.
So rational we are, so much we intellect appreciate.
Innovation, creativity, and development come not only from our köpfen.
They come out of ideas, which are engaged by the conviction in our hearts.
It is this kopf-herz-connection, from which I believe that it drives us, not only to be open to all the hellen and enthusiastic things, but also to the dark and problematic.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech politician, has once said:
“When we struggled against the oppression, we wanted everything possible, but what we most needed, war hope, a spiritual orientation, that alreadychaft, sometimes an hopnungslosen orten to be, and zeuge to be.”
This spiritual orientation is the core of what I believe that the Ted communities must also engage in it.
There is no abgrenzung about technology and design, which is uns permitted, whole and gar human to be, solange we don’t even have eyes and ears for weakness, abgrenzing and injustice.
This art of identity requires much more from us than if we do not care about ourselves.
She will touch her deeply.
as a junger lawyer had me the great privilege, rose parks to meet,
This older woman, johnnie carr, who den montgomery-busboykott had organized – an incredible African-American – and virginia durr, a white, whose ehemann, clifford durr, dr. king vertrat.
These women also met and just talked with each other.
ab und zu rief frau carr me then an and said, "bryan, frau parks comes in the city.
“Do you want to come and hear?”
And I said, “Yes, I really like it.”
She said, “And what will they do when they are here?”
I said, “I will hear.”
And I went around and just heard it.
It was always so inspiring, so beflügelnd.
One day I sat there and heard this woman to, and after a few hours drehte the woman parks to me um uns said, “Nun bryan, say me, what the ‘initiative for equal right’ is.”
What are they trying to<unk>?”
I start with my usual snack.
I said, “We are trying to act against injustice.
Wr wants to help the people who have been condemned innocently.
We want to fight prejudice and discrimination in the punishment system.
We want lifenslängliche weekstrafen without a conditional punishment for children abschaffen.
We want to do something against the death penalty.
We want to cut down the number of frogs.
We want to abstain the mass detention.”
I kept my usual vortrag, and then she saw me and said, “Mhmm.Mhmm.Mhmm.”
She said, “It will make her very, very tired.”
Then lehnte frau carr himself in front of me, put a finger on my face and said, “And that’s why she must be very, very bold.”
And that is why I believe that the Ted-community should be a tapferer.
We need to find ways to face these challenges: these problems, this leads.
Because letztlich depends on our humanity, on our all humanity ab.
I have learned simple things in my work.
I have learned a few simple things.
We are all more than the worst thing we’ve ever got.
I think this applies to every human being on this planet.
If someone lies, he is not just a liar.
If someone takes something that doesn’t belong to him, he’s not just a thief.
Whoever kills someone is not just a murderer.
And because that is so, there is a fundamental humanity that the law must respect.
I also believe that in many parts of this land, and with certainty in many parts of the land, the gegenteil von armut is not rich.
I don’t believe that.
I believe that an too many orten das gegenteil von armut justice is.
And finally I believe that, although it is so dramatic, so beautiful and inspiring, and so encouraging, we are not yet in our technology will be gemess, not in the things that we develop, not in our intellect and mind.
Finally, a society will not be measured by the way it treats its rich and powerful and privileged, but by the way it treats with the poor, the condemned, the imprisoned.
For in this context we just begin to understand the truly surprising things that appeal to us.
Sometimes I lose the balance. a story to the end.
Sometimes I get too much.
I’m tired like all of us.
Sometimes these ideas rise ahead of our thought, on a very important art and weise.
I get rid of these children who have been sentenced to a too hard punishment.
I go into the investigation prison and visit a mandant, who is 13 or 14 years old, and who should stand as an adult before the court.
Then I ask myself: how could this happen?
How can a richter transform someone into something that is not?
Der Richter sees him as an adult, but I see a kind.
One night I stayed too long up and thought, my dear, if a richter can transform us into something else, then it must have magical powers.
Bryan, der Richter hat magic.
You should also say what wishes you want.
And because it was late, and I couldn’t think right anymore, I fing an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an.
I had a 14-year-old, Armenian black boy as a mandant.
And I fing an with this quotation. the headline is: “Quotation, my armen, 14 year old black mandant to treat as a privileged, white, 75 year old top manager.”
In my request, I explained that the misconduct of the State Prosecutor's Office and the Police, as well as the procedural errors, should be taken into account.
There was a crazy zeil about that in this country there is nothing more right, that there is only misconduct.
The next morning I waited up and didn’t know anymore, whether I had just dreamed about this mad question or had it actually written.
And to my enthusiasm, I had not only written it, but also sent it to the court.
A few months passed and I had just forgotten everything.
Finally, but I decided, my God, I must and ins judgment and this foolish fall.
I stieg in the car and was really overwhelmed – overwhelmed.
I also go to the court.
I thought it would be so hard, so painful.
I eventually climbed out of my car and went the stairs up to the court.
when I die treppe to the court highging. was there a elder, schwarzer mann, the hausmeister in the court.
When he saw me, where he was over me and said, “Who are you?”
I said, “I am an attorney.” he said, “You are an attorney?” I said, “Yes.”
Go to me and get tired of me.
Then flüsterte er me ins ohr.
He said, “I’m so proud of you.”
And I have to say, it gave me power.
It touched something very deep in me, identity, the ability of each individual, something to contribute to a community, to a perspective of hope.
I am entering the trial.
sobald der richter me sah,
He said, “Mr. Stevenson, have you asked this crazy question?”
I said, “Yes,” and then we started to discuss.
More and more people came here, just because they were wütend,
I thought I had written this mad story.
police officers kamen herein and stellvertretende state lawyers and office officers.
Im handumdrehen war der Gerichtssaal voller menschen, who wütend were that we over hautfarbe sprachen, over armut, over inequality.
From my eye angle I saw the hausmeister up and ab go.
He looked again and again through the window and could hear the whole tohuwabohu.
He went up and ab.
Finally, I got this older black man with a very worried face expression in the court and sat right behind me, beinahe on the defense bank.
Ten minutes later, der Richter announced a break.
During the pause kam a police officer herein, den es störte that der hausmeister im Gerichtssaal war.
This deputy rannte over to the older schwarzen .
He said, “Jimmy, what are you doing in the trial?”
The elder black man stands up. er sah den deputy an, then sah er me an, and er said, "I bin hergekommen, to say to this young man, they lose the soul not out of the eyes. give them not up. "
I came to it because I believe that many of them have understood that the moral pendel of the universes is far out, but that it is the righteousness.
That we as human beings are not fully developed, solange we do not take care of human rights and fundamental values.
That all of us survive with them survive each individual is connected.
That we need to connect our vision of technology and design, entertainment and creativity with humanity, compassion and justice.
And above all, I want one of them, who see the ebenso, to simply say: they lose the soul not out of the eyes; they do not give up.
They have seen and heard, with this audience, this community, an obvious desire to help them and to do something.
What can we do to tun?
Bryan Stevenson: Well, there are everywhere possibilities.
If they live in California, there is there in this morning a volksentscheid, with them it is darum goes, in fact an effort to undertake, something from the money stream umzuleiten, which otherwise flows into the politics of punishment.
Here, in California for example, in the next five years a billion dollars will be spent for the death penalty. a billion dollars.
And yet 46% of all murder crimes do not end with a detention.
56% of all violent cases do not come before the court.
Here is the chance to do something.
This referendum will propose to invest the money in more security forces and security.
I think there are possibilities everywhere.
During the last three decades, the verbrechensrate in America has been immense reduced.
This tattoos is often placed in a connection with the increased prison numbers.
What would you say to someone who believes?
In fact, the number of violent crimes has not changed much.
The majority of mass detention in this country did not really take place in the class of violent crimes.
Es war der fehlgeleitete creuzzug against drugs.
Therefore, the dramatic hohen zahlen pri den prisoninsassen comes.
We have left ourselves in the rhetoric of the punishment.
Now we have the "three-verstöße" -gesetze, which brings man forever behind the gitter, for a fahrraddiebstahl, for the diebstahl geringfügigen gutes, rather than that man it zwingt, that the things of the sacrifice to return.
I believe, we need to get more tun to help people who have become victims of a straftat, not less.
And I believe that our jetzige punishment philosophy doesn’t help anyone.
I believe that it is what we need to change.
Bryan, you have really brought here a site zum schwingen.
They are an inspiring personality.
Thank you very much for being here.Thank you very much.

This is a disaster, a disaster.
Oh my God.
So these are just a few of the clips I’ve collected over the last six months – but they could have been the last six days, or the last six years.
Tatasche is that the media is preferred to show uns negative themes because our mind accurately draws attention to this topic.
And there is also a very good reason for it.
Every second one tages catch our mind much more informationen on than our hirn jemals can process.
And because nothing is more important to us than our survival, the first haltestelle for all the informationen is a part of our temporallappens, the amygdala.
The amygdala is also our early warnsystem, our danger detector.
It is sorted and passed through all the information on the search for any spirit of dangers in our surroundings.
If we also see the news, we prefer to keep it out after negative news.
and das alte sprichwort &quot; if it blutet, the demand increases &quot; is very true.
Now, with all our digital geräten, which uns seven take the woche, 24 hours am tag all these negative news zustellen, it is no wonder that we are pessimistic.
It is no wonder that everyone thinks that the world is getting worse.
But this may not be the case.
Per<unk> it is the reality.
Per<unk> the enormous progress that we have made in the last century through a series of crevents accelerates so strong that in the next three decades it will be possible to create a world of overflusses.
Well, I don’t say that we don’t have any big problems – climacrisis, artensterben, water and energy problems – that we already have.
And as men we are much better darin, problems on a very long sight ahead, but they are ultimately yet to overcome.
Let us look at what we have achieved in the last century, so that we can predict the development.
In the last 100 years, the average life expectancy has more than doubled, and the average income of the world’s population has doubled.
Children’s mortality has decreased by about a tenth.
In addition, the costs of food, electricity, transport and communication have decreased a lot.
Steve Pinker has shown us that we are currently living in a very peaceful time of human history.
and laut Charles Kenny is the alphabetization rate in the past 130 years from 25% to 80% gestiegen.
We live in a truly extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
We are constantly raising our expectations.
In fact, we have armut neu defined.
bedenken sie, that a large anteil of the Americans, who live under the armuts limit, have access to strom, wasser, toilets, refrigerators, fernseher, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars.
The richest capitalists of the last centuries, the emperors of the land, would never have dreamed of such luxury goods.
The foundation for many of them forms technology, and these grow expotentially.
mein guter freund ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool, which will be the information technology, will be on the curve of moores legislation, and the price-performance-quotient all 12 to 24 months verdoppelt.
Darum kostet das mobile phone in their pocket about a million times less and is a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 70ern .
Now look at this curve.
That is the moores law of the last hundred years.
Be aware of two things in this curve.
First and foremost – in good as in bad times, crieg or frieden, resession, depression, and high-conjunktur.
That is the ergebnis of faster computers, which build faster computers.
They slow down for no of our great problems.
In addition, despite their logarithmic verlaufs on the left side, they run up.
The growth rate itself also accelerates itself.
And on this curve, on the back of the moores law, we find a series of exceptional technologies that are available to everyone.
&quot; cloud-computing &quot;, something, das my friends at autodesk &quot; infinite-computing &quot; nennen, sensors and networks, robots, 3d-printers, which enable the personal production on our planet to democratize, synthetic biology, fuel, infusion and recording, digital medicine, nano-materials and artificial intelligence.
How many of them have the sieg of ibms supercomputer watson bei &quot; risk &quot; seen ?
That was great.
I’ve missed the times and searched for the best schlagzeilen I could find.
I love this : &quot; watson bezwingt human gegner . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game.
It is necessary to understand the nuances of the speech.
You can imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone.
vor vier jahren starteten ray kurzweil and I here bei ted a new university, which &quot; singularity university &quot; means.
We bring our students all of these technologies with a special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of mankind.
And every year we ask the students,<unk>, products and services to create which within a decade can positively affect the lives of billions of people.
They think that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people.
30 years ago, this would have been ridiculous.
Today we can refer to dozens of companies that have achieved exactly this.
If I think of creating overfluss, then I do not mean a life voller luxury for one on this planet; it goes for me to create a life voller possibilities.
It goes darum, out knappen gütern overfluss to create.
knappheit is a context-bezogen, and technology is a resource-liberating power.
Here is a example.
This is the history of Napoleon III. in the not of the 18th century.
This is the type of links.
Er hat den König von Siam zum Abendessen.
Napoleon soldaten bekamen silber-besteck, Napoleon himself bekam gold-besteck.
Der König von Siam, however, bekam aluminium-besteck .
Aluminium was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet, more valuable than gold and platinum.
This is the reason why the kuppel des Washington-monuments from aluminium was made.
Although aluminium takes 8.3 percent of the land mass, it does not come as reines metal vor.
It is connected by nitrogen and silicate.
But then the technology of the electrolysis was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so affordable that we use it with our wegwerf-mentality.
Then let us project this analogy badly in the future.
Today we think of an energy.
My ladies and gentlemen, we live on a planet that is filled with 5,000-fold more energy than we annually consume.
16 terawatt energy prasseln every 88 minutes on the erdoberfläche.
This is not a shortness, the problem is accessibility.
And there are good news.
In this year, it was the first time man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man man
The cost of solar energy fielen in the last year is about 50 percent.
Last month has been published a study that shows that up to the end of this jahrzehnts in the solar gegenden of the U.S. solar energy will cost 6 cent per kwh, in comparison to 15 cent in the national average.
And if we have an energy surplus, then we will also have wasser im surplus.
We are talking about the wasser-war.
remember it, as carl sagan das voyager-space vehicle 1990 , as es am saturn vorbeigezogen war , back in direction erde drehte ?
This is a famous photo on. what is it?
&quot; a pale blue dot. &quot;
We live on a water planet.
We live on a planet that is about 70 percent with wasser bedeckt.
Yes, there are 97.5 percent salzwasser, 2 percent are vereist, and we fight about 0.5 percent des wassers on the planet, but here there is also hope.
And there are new technologies, not in 10 or 20 jahren, but now.
They are new nanotechnologies on the way, nano-materials.
And from a conversation this morning with dean kaman, one of the innovators des do it yourself, I would like to share something with them – er gave me the permission – his technolgie, which &quot; slingshot &quot; means, and from which many of them may have already heard.
can a thousand liters sauberes drinkwasser per tag from various quellen erzeugen – ob salzwasser, verschmutztes wasser, latrine – and all das for less than 2 cents per liter.
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just eingewilligt to launch a large test project with a hundred units in developing countries.
And if everything goes well, and I am very confident, then Coca-Cola will use this technology globally in 206 countries on the entire planet.
This is the technology-backed innovation that exists today.
And we’ve seen this in mobile phones as well.
We reach bald the 70 percent abdeckungsrate of mobile phones in developing countries until the end of 2013.
bedenken sie nur that a massai warrior with a handy in the not of kenia a better mobile communication has as president reagan vor 25 jahren.
And if they search with their smartphone on Google, they have more access to know and informationen as President Clinton is 15 years ago.
They live in a world that information and communication im overfluss has, as it is no one ever could have predicted.
And it comes even better, the things for which you and I have spent several thousand dollars – GPS, HD-video and photo, libraries voller books and music, technology to medical diagnostics – are now literally entmaterialized and cheaper in their handy.
And the best of that is probably what our health is expecting.
In the last month I had das vergnügen , mit der qualcomm-stiftung den so mentioned &quot; $ 10 millionen qualcomm tricorder x prize &quot; anzukündigen .
We demand teams around the world out, all these technologies to connect with each other in a mobile phone so that you can talk with the gerät, since it is with ki out-of-the-counter, you can reinhusten or test your blood values.
And in order to win, the doctor must make a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified physicians.
They put themselves this gerät vor. in the middle of a developing country, where there is no medicine, but 25 percent of the disease and 1.3 percent of the collaborator of health.
If this gerät a rna- or DNA-virus sequenziert, which is unknown, it ruft the health authority and prevents a pandemic before its outbreak.
But now to the greatest power, which will lead us to a world of surplus.
I don't know &quot; the next billion &quot;.
The white lines stand for the population.
We have just exceeded the 7 billion mark.
And only on the other hand, the greatest insecurity against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition throughout the world.
In 2010, we had just under two billion people online connected to each other.
By 2020 we are expected to rise from two to five billion internet users.
Three billion new buyers, of which we have never heard before, will join the global communication.
What do these people need?
What do you want? what do you want? what do you want?
And instead of economic stability, I see one of the greatest economic turmoil in history.
These men represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy.
And they will be healthier by the use of the tricoders, and they will be better trained by the Khan Academy, and by doing so that they will have the opportunity to use 3d-drucker and infinite computing, and so much more productive than jemals zuvor.
So what can 3 billion wachsende, healthy, gebildete, productive members of the menschengemeinde bring us?
How would it be with a satz neuer, not zuvor gehörter stimmen.
How would it be to give the oppressed, wherever they are, a stimulus to pay attention to themselves and to generate change, to allerersten evil?
What will these three billion people contribute to?
How would it be with contributions that we can’t even predict?
One of the things I’ve learned through the X Prize is that small teams, motivated by passion and focus, can create extraordinary things, things that big<unk> and governments can only create in the past.
I want to conclude with a story that really excited me.
There is a program that some might already know.
It’s a game, that’s foldit.
It was developed at the University of Washington in Seattle.
And it’s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop.
According to his behavior, we can predict the structure and function.
And this is very important in medical research.
So far, this was a problem for supercomputers.
and this game was played by university professors etc. .
And there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online.
And it has shown that today the human pattern recognition is better that protein is missing than the best supercomputer.
And when these people kamen and scut, who the best protein-ordner of the world is, this was no mit-professor, nor a caltech-student, it was someone from England, Manchester, a woman, who tagsüber as an assistant of the management in a rehabilitation clinic works and night the best protein-ordner of the world war.
My ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in our future, is the tattoos that we today have more power than individuals to face the great challenges of our planet.
We have access to tools with exponentieller technology.
We have the passion of a DIY-innovator.
We have the capital of the techno-philanthrop.
And we have three billion new shopping, with which we can work online to master the new challenges, and to do what is necessary.
We are looking forward to a few exceptional jahrzehnte.
Thank you very nice.
I believe that we have to do something against a verchanges-value piece of medical culture.
I think it starts with a doctor and it’s me.
And maybe I’ve been long enough in the business, as if I’m allowing me to give up a piece of my own false prestiges to enable this.
But before I get to the real topic of my vortrages, let us start with a little baseball.
Hey, why not?
We are the seasonal naked and move on to the world championship.
We all love baseball, right?
Baseball is full of tollen statistics.
And there are hundreds of them.
&quot; moneyball &quot; erscheint bald and dreht yourself about statistics and um these to use a great baseball team opzustellen .
I’m going to refer to a statistics from which I hope that most of them have heard badly.
It is the perchnittspower of the schlägers.
We’re talking about a 300 when a 300 slaughter.
That means that the player is sure to hit 3 out of 10 hits.
That means the ball in the outer field strikes, it comes up, it will not be captured, and who the ball tries to have the first base to throw, it does not succeed in time and the runner was in safety.
Three out of 10.
Do you know how to call a 300ter in major league baseball?
Well, really good, maybe a all-star.
Do you know how to call a 400ter?
That's someone who's sure 4 out of 10 trifft.
Legendary - like Ted Williams legendary - the last major league baseball player der during a regular season over 400 times traf .
Let us return to my world of medicine transfer, in which I feel a little better or<unk> a little less well after which I have talked to them about it.
They have a blinddarment inflammation and they are transferred to a operator whose perchnittspower is 400 in reference to blinddarment inflammation.
It doesn’t work somehow, right?
It is believed that they live in a certain aboriginal gend and they have a loved man with verstopftened hercocracy vessels and their hospital doctor sends them to a cardiologist, whose perchnittsperformance at the presentation of the vessels is 200.
But do you know what?
She is this jahr much better. she is on the rising ast.
It has a 257 score.
Sometimes it does not work.
But I will ask you a question.
What do you think about how the perchnittsperformance should be for a cardiologist or a sickwester or an ortopedist, a birth helper, a rescue assistant?
A thousand, very good.
The truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or rescue assistant should be.
What we do, however, is that we are one of them, I am included, in the world sent out with them an appeal to be perfect.
Never make a mistake, but no one can think about the details, how this should be achieved.
And this is the message that I have received in my medical school.
I was an obsessive student.
In the high school, a mitschüler said that Brian Goldmann would learn for a bluttest.
And so was it too.
and I learn in my small dachstube in the schwestern residenz am toronto general hospital, unweit von hier.
I learn everything outdoors.
In my anatomyvorlesung I learn the origin and outsourcing of each muscle, one zweig of one artery, which from the aorta leads away, obskure and usual differential diagnosis.
I know even the differential diagnosis of renal tubular azidosis to classify.
And all the time I gather more and more knowledge.
And I was good, I closed my cum laude ab.
And I left the medical school with the impression that I am, if I know everything outside and know everything, or at least so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible, so much as possible.
And it worked for a time long until I frau drucker traf.
I resided in a lehrkrankenhaus here in Toronto as a frau drucker zu mir in the notfallabteilung des krankenhauses was brought.
At this time I was assigned to the cardiological schicht in the cardiological service.
And it was my order, as the notfallpersonal cardiological rat suchte, the notfallpatient to investigate.
and give a feedback to my oberarzt.
I studied frau drucker and she war in atemnot.
And when I heard her, made her a keuchende geräusche.
And when I broke her chest with the stethoscope, I could hear a crushing noise on both sides, that told me that she was under congestive herzinsuffizienz a little.
That is a state in which the heart fails, rather than that the whole blood continues to pump, a part of the blood is placed in the lunge fest and fills them all the way, therefore, the curcuma.
This was not a difficult diagnosis.
I put it in place and made me on that treatment.
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medicine to take the Druck vom Herzen.
I gave her medicine, which we call diuretics, wasser tablets, so she gave her fluidity.
And over a time of one and a half to two hours, she finged to feel better.
I feel really good.
And then I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
I actually made two errors.
I send them home without talking to my oberarzt.
I nahm not the horer up and made what I should have, what a call at my oberarzt would have been about to abzuklären with him, so that he had a chance to have made his own picture.
And er know her, er would have been in the low additional informationen to her beizusteuern.
Maybe I’m doing it with a good reason.
Per<unk> I didn’t want to be the help-bed-of-the-art doctor.
Per<unk> I wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that I acted so and so I would be in the disposal for my patient to worry without having to contact him.
My second mistake was worse.
dadurch das i sie nach hause schickte, missachtete i a leise stimme in me, which tried me to say, &quot; goldman, no good idea.
in really fehlte is me so very an self-confidence that I the krankenschwester fragte, which is a woman drucker care, &quot; glauben sie das es in ordnung is, when she goes home? &quot;
And the krankenschwester thought about it after and said in real art, &quot; clear, I think it will go well. &quot;
I remember it as if it was a gestern.
I will also sign the dismissal papers and a hospital car and rescue assistants and take them home.
And I get back to that job.
Den restlichen tag, den abend I had this nagende feeling in my magen.
But I continue to work.
and am ende des tages packte I my stuff, verlies the hospital and went to the parking place to drive with the car to the house, as I do something, that I did not do otherwise.
I went through the emergency department on my way home.
And there said another krankenschwester, not the sister who had seen after frau drucker, but another three words to me and these three words fear the most notfallarzte I know.
Other physicians are afraid of this ebenso, but the notfall medicine is very special because we see the patient just so flirting.
The three words lauten: do you remember?
&quot; do you remember the patient, the patient, the patient? &quot; do you remember the patient, the patient? &quot;
Fragte the krankenschwester sachlich.
&quot; also she is back, &quot; said she in this particular tonlage.
She was also back.
She was back and I was dying.
About an hour after they came to the house, after I sent her to the house, she collapsed and the family called 911 an. the rescue assistants brought her back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50, which is a dangerous shock state.
She attmete kaum and war blue angelaufen.
The notfallpersonal zog all stränges.
She gave her blutdruckerhöher.
She closed her an the beatmungsmachine an.
I was shocked and until in the inside zerrüttet.
And I lived through this backbone because she came to the intensive station after stabilization and I hoped she would recover.
And after two or three tights it became clear that she would not wake up again.
She had an untreatable gehirnschaden erlitten.
Her family gathered together.
And during the next eight or nine days, they got up and succeeded.
Amuten tag liesen she goes -- frau drucker, a woman, a mutter and a grandmutter.
It is said that you do not forget the name derer die versterben.
And that was the first time that I did this myself.
I felt alone, isolated, not the art of healthy shame, that man felt, because man cannot talk to the colleague about it.
They all know the healthy shame, if you give a mystery of the best friends price, although this one is on the deprivation and man then is erwisht and the best friend confronts one with it and my a terrible discussion leads, if one is at the end, however, the bad conscience leads, and you swear that you do not make such a mistake again.
If you are regaining and the mistake is never regaining.
This is the art of lehrreicher sham.
The unhealthy art over which I speak is the one that makes a person sick.
It is the one who says that not what man has done is evil, but that man himself is evil.
And that was what I felt.
And it was not because of my oberarztes, it was very cute.
er sprach with the family and I am sure that er the wogen glättete and sure stellte that I<unk>’t be prosecuted.
But I ask myself this question.
Why don’t I ask the oberarzt? why do I send her home?
And then in my worst moment: how could I make such a foolish mistake?
Why did I go to the medicine?
It’s slow but sure it’s going.
I’m starting to feel better.
And then an bewölkten tag, was there a loch in the cloud and the sun brach out and I told me maybe I can feel better again.
And I handled with me out that if I falls my efforts to perfection verdoppelte and never again a mistake beging that the stimms could verstummen.
And she did it.
And I continue to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I had a service in the notfall station in a municipal krankenhaus nördlich von Toronto and I begutachtete a 25 years old man with gereiztem rachen.
There was a lot of them and I in yesterday.
It is always shown here.
I watched in the rachen and it was a little little pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him strongly.
And even when he went out of the tree, he showed himself on his rack.
Two days later I came to my next notfall service and my chefärztin bat me on a conversation in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
&quot; do you remember an den patient with them reizten rachen? &quot;
It found out that there is a streptokokken-infection.
He had a potentially life-threatening disease called epiglottitis.
They can googlen, but it is not an infection of the rachens, but of the oberen atemwege and causes the closure of the atemwege.
Fortunately, it’s not dead.
It is intraveneous antibodies and regains a few days later.
And I went again through the same torture of shame and self-discovery, felt free and went to the work until it happened again and again and again.
In a notfallschicht I have forgotten a blinddarment inflammation twice.
There are already some of this, especially if you consider that you work in a hospital that at that time had only 14 patients per night.
In both cases, I did not send them home and there was probably no game in their treatment.
If one thought I would have niersteine.
I ordnete das röntgen der nieren an. as das ohne befund war, stellte my college in the reproduction of the patient a verhärtung in the underlying right sector fest and rief the operateure.
The other had a strong breakthrough.
I order fluide an in order to rehydrate him and bat my colleague to begutachten him too.
And as it is a heightening in the right under the sector feststellte, rief is the operateure.
In both cases, they were operated and they went well.
Both falls nagten an me, fracturizing me.
And I would be happy to be able to tell them that my worst mistakes only in the first five jahren passed, what many of my colleagues behave, but totaler unsinn is.
Manchers of my clops passed in the last five years.
Alone, shameful and without support.
here lies the problem: if I cannot conclude with my errors and over them can talk, if I fall the quiet stim, which tells me, what really happens cannot find, how can I then share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them my mistakes so that they don’t do the same?
If I fall into a room ginge—as now, then I have no idea what you think about me.
When did you have heard the last time by someone the von fehlschlag über fehlschlag über fehlschlag sprach?
Oh yeah, they go to a cocktail party and you may hear someone about any other doctor, but you will not hear someone about your own mistakes.
If I went into a room full with colleagues and about their immediate support would be bitten and begin to tell them what I just told them, I would very likely not reach the end of the second story before it would really be unpleasant to them, anybody would have a witz oneflechten, they would change the topic and the rest forget.
And in fact, if I or my colleagues knew that a ortopedist in my hospital had taken someone the false bein, then believe me, I would have trouble looking at him in the eyes.
This is the system in which we live.
It is a total denial of fehlern.
It is a system in which there are two basic positions—the ones that make mistakes and the ones that do not; the ones that sleep deficiency is limited and the ones without restrictions, the ones with bad ergebnissen and the ones with good ergebnissen.
It is almost an ideological reaction like an anti-body that attacks a man.
And there is the idea that if we are the ones that make the errors out of the medicine verbannen that we remain a safe system.
But there are two problems with it.
In my approximately 20 years of medical sendungsbewusstseins and journalism, I have a personal medical study on medical errors and false treatments created around so everything me possible for one of my first article, the I for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat, black art &quot;, wrote, to learn.
And what I learned is that errors are absolutely indispensable.
We work in a system in them one tag errors happen, in them one of 10 medications is either a false or false dosed, in them krankenhaus infections always and always become more and more numerous and ruins or all cause.
In this state, approximately 24,000 Canadians die an impossible error.
In the unified state beziffert the Institute for Medicine that zahl at 100,000.
Both are strong undertreibungen because we do not look so accurately as we should.
It is the crux.
In a krankenhaussystem in them the medical know each two to three years verdoppelt, we can’t mithalten.
Sleepmangel is allgegenworth.
We cannot get rid of it.
We possess a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect disease course for a patient with brustschmerzen.
Then I take the patient myself with brustschmerz, make him verschwitzt and schwätzig and give another slightly alcoholized atem to that and suddenly the story is intermitted with negligence.
I don’t take the same course.
I am not a robot; I do not always do things the same.
And my patients are not cars; they tell me their symptoms are not always in the same art.
All the errors are inevitable.
If man also the system so takes, as I’m learned, and all the errors have been taught, and all the errors have been taught, and all the errors have been taught, and all the errors have been taught, and all the errors have been taught.
And do you know the leier about men who do not want to talk about their worst cases?
in my sendung &quot; white coat , black art. &quot; I have the angewone to say, &quot; this is my schlimmster error &quot; I would be to everyone from the rescue assistant to the chefarzt of the cardiologist say, &quot; this is my schlimmster error &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what is with her ? &quot; and then show me with the microphone to him .
And then extend their pupils, they are in front of the kopf gestoßen, then look at them runter and schlucken heavy, and fangen an to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, &quot; shau, do not make diesel errors, which I manufactured. &quot;
What they need is an environment that they are put in place to do so.
What they need is a new medical culture.
And it begins with a doctor.
The newly defined physician is a man, who knows about his humanity, accepts it, is not proud to make mistakes, but puts everything in it to learn something from them, so that it can be transmitted.
She shares her experiences with others.
She supports when others speak of her errors.
And she shows others their errors, not um bloßzustellen, but in a loving, supporting art so that everyone can benefit from it.
And she works in a medical culture that acknowledges that humans fill the system with life and if that is so, then humans make errors of time to time.
So that the system develops backups to create, which makes it easier to detect errors, which makes people unavoidable and it ebenso allows to create loving, supporting spaces, in which anyone who observes the health consciousness, can actually address things, which potential errors present and for that even will be rewarded. and that especially for people like me, who make errors and for the burial of these should be rewarded.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am the newly defined physician.
I’m a man, I’m making a mistake.
I'm trying to learn from it, but I'm trying to learn from it, and I'm trying to learn from it, and I'm trying to learn from it, and I'm trying to learn from it.
I don’t know what they keep from me, but I can live with it.
Let me be closed with three of my own words: I remind me.
I’m going to talk about a winzige, small idea.
This is a variable standard.
And because you can explain this idea in a minute, I will tell you three stories in advance to take advantage of the time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
You know that it was 1835 here war.
They may think that it’s finken hunt, but that’s not right.
In fact, sammelte is fish.
Er described one of them as very &quot; usual &quot; .
It was a Zackenbarsch.
bis in the 80er jahre hinein, was er in great style fisched.
It is now on the roten list of danger species.
This story we have heard many male von den galápagos-inseln or von anderen orten, she is not very special.
However, we are still arriving on the Galápagos Island.
We still think that they are original.
The brochure describes it still as untouched.
What has happened here?
The second history must be a different concept, the variable taillenweite, verdeutlichen.
Because I had it erlebt when I studied a lagoon in West Africa in 1971.
I went there because I wuchs in Europe up and wanted to work later in Africa.
I thought I could integrate myself.
And I get a bad sonnenbrand and was convinced that I really wasn’t from there stammte.
It was my erster sonnenbrand.
As you see, it was the lagoon of palm and of a couple of mangroven umsäumt.
es gab buntbarsche von approximately 20 Zentimeter, schwarzkinnmaulbrüter, a underart der buntbarsche.
The fishgründe of this buntbarsche were very ertragreich and the fishers lived well from it and deserved in ghana overdurchhly good .
When I returned there 27 years later, the fish was cut to half its size.
They measured five centimeters.
They were genetically eradicated.
They were still fish.
The people were still happy.
And the fish also had the happiness of not being there.
Nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third little story tells me of my mittäterschaft in the introduction of the schleppnetzfischerei in Southeast Asia.
In the 70s – rather to the beginning of the 60s – Europe promoted many development projects.
Fischförderung bedeutete ländern, which already 100 000 fish fingen, den industriellen fischfang this quite hässliche shiff is called mutiara 4 .
I fuhr it with and we make erhebungen throughout the southern South China lake and especially in the javasee.
We didn’t have a word for what we fingen there.
I know now that it is the cause of the sea war.
90 percent of our fangs were swamme, other tiere, which are connected with them.
The largest part of the fish, the small points there on the trümmern, the trümmerhaufen, were corallenriff-fische.
Immense important kam der Grund des Meeres on Deck and was then returned.
These images are extraordinary, because the transition goes very quickly.
Within one jahre, one carries through an erhebung and then begins with the industrial fishing.
out – in this case – a hard ground or weichen coral will be matschiger mist.
This is a dead schildkröte.
They were not eaten, man warf them away because they were dead.
Once we found a lifend.
She was not eroded yet.
Then they wanted to kill them, because they could eat them well.
In fact, this mountain of trümmern will be collected every time of fischern, when they ride in regions, in which it has not yet been fitted.
But it is not documented.
We change the world, but we don’t remember it.
We match our norm values to the new level and call us not in memory, what was there war.
If you are verallgemeinert, pass the following.
On the y-achse there are a few good things: biodiversity, the number of orcas, the green of their landes, the wasservorrat.
It changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time, it changes with time.
Each generation considers the images, which they take to begin their conscious lives, as standard and will capture everything of it.
The difference is then perceived as a loss.
But they do not realize the lost things that have passed.
There can be a sequence of changes.
And at the end they only want to get the terrible remains.
This is precisely what is now far from our soul.
We want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer as they were.
You might now think that the problem concerns men, who<unk>, when they lived in rabbitic societies, killed animals and who only after a few generations became aware of what they had gotten.
For obviously it will be a tier, which is very frequently there, first once rarely, before it is outsourbed.
Man loses also no frequently occurring there.
Man verliert always rare tiere.
And therefore it is not perceived as a great loss.
With the time we focus on the big animals and in the more are the big fish.
They become more rare because we catch them.
With the time, little fish remains and we think that’s the normal value.
The question is why the people accept it.
Now because they don’t know that it was a different time.
Of course, many people, scientists, will confirm that it’s really different war.
They will confirm it, for the evidence, as they presented in a previous form, is not as they would like to present the evidence.
There is for example the anecdote that the message of a captain soundso, which in this gegend great fischvorkommen beobachtete, cannot be used, or by fischereiwissenschaftlern is usually not valued, because it is not &quot; scientific &quot; is.
We also have the situation that the people do not know the past, although we live in formed societies, because they do not trust the sources of the past.
That shows the enormous major role that a multi-protectional area can play.
Through more protection areas, we put the past in the ground again here.
We put the past back to it, which people cannot understand, because the norm values have changed and are very low.
This allows the people who see a more-protectional area and those who benefit from their insight, to restore their norm values.
What about the people to whom this is not possible because they have no access – the man in the middle of the west to the example?
Here you can, I think, the art and the film maybe fill the gap, as well as simulations.
This is the simulation of the Chesapeake Bay.
Vor langer Zeit gab es dort grauwale – vor 500 jahren.
and the colour and -schattierungen remind them<unk> an &quot; avatar &quot; .
If they think about an avatar, if they think about why these people were so touched by it – apart from the pocahontas history, why were they so touched by the images world?
Because it’s something wachruft, that in some way is lost.
My recommendation also, the only one that I will give, directs itself an cameron, so that it is &quot; avatar ii &quot; under wasser dreht.
A lot of thanks.
In the eighties of the year, in the communist Ostdeutschland, man had to register, if man had a writer’s machine, this at the government.
They must also register a blatt with beispieltext from this writer machine.
Der Grund dafür: the government could reverfolgen, wo a text herkam.
If they found an article with a false gedankengut, they could discover the urheber of this gedankengut.
And we in the West could not understand how anyone could do something like that, and how much that would restrict the freedom of the network.
In our own country, we<unk>’t do anything like that.
But if you buy a new color printer from the leading laser printer manufacturers and print a seite, then this seite has a helle yellow flecke printed on each seite, in a pattern that the seite clearly leaves it and its printer back.
That happens to us today.
And it seems that no one is excited about it.
And that was an example of how our own governments use the technology against us, the citizens, on the way.
And that is one of the three main sources of the online problems that exist today.
Let’s take a look at what really happens in the world: we can divide the attacks into categories.
We have three main groups.
There are online criminals.
To be seen here, this is Mr. Dimitry Golubow from Kiev in the Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These people earn money.
They use online-attacks to make a lot of money, a huge hacking money.
There are several known cases of online-millionaire, multi-millionaire who have earned their money through attacks.
This is Vladimir Tsastsin aus tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
Stephen Watt.
The Bear Sundin.
Das sind matthew anderson, tariq al-daour and so further and so strong.
These people are online too wealth came, but they have it illegal erworben by using them, for example, trojaner have used, um money from our bank accounts to klauen, while we do our online banking, or even keylogger, who have collected our credit card information when entering through the keyboard, while we have purchased through an infected computer online.
The U.S. intelligence agency (U.S. intelligence agency) issued two months before the Swiss account of Mr. Sam Jain hier ein, and on this account were 14.9 million US-dollars, when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain himself is on freiem fuß, the residence is unknown.
And I argue that today it is more likely that we are a victim of an online crime than a crime in the real world.
And it is very obvious that this will only get worse.
In the future, most of the criminals will abspire online.
The second-largest attack group, which we can observe today, is not motivated by money.
They are motivated by something else - protests like, a Meinung, or through their audience.
groups like anonymous have risen over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players on the field of online attacks.
There are also the three main attack groups: criminals, who are the money because of tun, hacktivists and anonymous, who give this resistance, but the last group are nations, governments, who lead the attack.
It is like der von diginotar.
It shows beispielhaft, what happens when governments attack their own citizen.
Diginotar is a full-power certificate from the Netherlands – or war is das.
In the last herbst it had to be insolvency admitted, because diginotar war was hacked.
Someone was ingebrochen and had the system gründlich gehackt.
and letzte woche in a meeting with a Dutch government representative I put one of the leaders of this group the question, whether it is possible, that due to the des diginotar-hacks leute were gestorben.
And his answer war &quot; and &quot; .
Now, how do you die in the folge of a solchen hacks?
Diginotar is a certification body.
They sell certificates.
What do you do with the certificates?
Now, a certificate needs man, if man a website with https, with ssl-verschlüsselten service hat, zum beispiel gmail.
Now we use all, or many of us, gmail, or one of their competitors. yet these services are<unk> common in totalitarian states such as those of Iran, where dissident foreign providers such as gmail use, since they know that they can trust them more than local anbietern and that they are encrypted over ssl-connections, so that the local government cannot in their conversations herumschnüffeln.
You can, however, if you are in a foreign country.
The certification authority has hacked and banned false certificates.
And that’s exactly what’s happening in the falle of diginotar.
What about the Arab early days and the things that have happened for example in Egypt?
Now, in Egypt, the rebels in April 2011 plundered the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police.
In this act there was a ordner name &quot; finfisher &quot; .
And in this order was a note of a company based in Germany, which had sold a few programs to the Egyptian government, with which they could - in a very large amount - capture any communication from the Egyptian citizens.
They had sold this program for €280,000 to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters is here.
The Western governments also provide totalitarian governments with hilfsmitteln so that they can act against their own bourgeoisie.
But the western governments also help themselves.
to beispiel in German only before a few weeks of the so-called state-strojaner found. that was a Trojaner, which was used by the German government representative, to bespitzeln their own bourgeoisie.
If they are suspected in a criminal case, then their phone will be angezapft with quite a certainty.
But today we are far away from that.
They zapfen their internet connection an.
They use means such as the state-strojaner to play their computer with a Trojaner, which allows them to monitor their entire communication, their online discussions abzuhören, their passwords to gather.
If we also continue to think about such things, then it would be the obvious answer of the people: &quot; ok, that sounds bad, but it concerns me and not, because I am a brave citizen.
I don’t have to worry about it!
I have nothing to hide. &quot;
And this argument does not raise sense.
Privacy must be given.
Privacy is not to be discussed.
There is no choice between privacy and security.
It is a decision between freedom and control.
And while we can trust our governments today, in January 2011, every right that we give is granted forever.
And trust us, trust us blind to a single future government, a government that we may have in fifty years?
These are the questions we have to deal with for the next 50 years.
It may seem seltsam to them, but I am a big fan of betonblocksteinen.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 and originated with a simple idea: module out of cement with fixed measures that match together.
Betonbausteine became very quickly the mostgenutzte baueinheit in the world.
They versetzten us in the lage, things to build, which were greater than us, buildings, bridges, a stone after them others.
The immense war of the betonbaustein has become the baustein of our time.
Fast a hundred years later, in 1947, kam lego hiermit out.
It was called the &quot; automatic verbindende stone &quot;.
And within a few jahre, zog lego in one haushalt one.
It is estimated that more than 400 billion stones have been produced - or 75 stones for each person on this planet.
They don’t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, or beautiful buildings.
Lego machte is possible for everyone.
lego hat im wesentlichen den betonbaustein, den baustein der welt, genommen and daraus a baustein made for our imagination.
In the meantime, the next revolution was announced in the same year at the bell labs, the next baustein.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would bring us from a world of static, aufeinandergestapelten bausteine to a world in which everything interactive war.
as der betonblock, allow us der transistor much larger, complexere crossroads to build, a stone after them others.
But there is a major difference: the transistor war only for experts.
I personally accept that it is not that the bastion of our time is reserved for experts and therefore I decided to change it.
vor eight jahren was I am media lab and I begann this idea to erforschen how man the power of the engineer in the hand of artists and designers could leg.
Vor a few jahren fing I an littlebits to develop .
Let me show them how they work.
Littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function.
They are vorgefertigt to be light, tone, engine and sensor.
And the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets.
So you can’t put them together false herum.
The stones are colored.
green is ausgabe, blue is strom, pink is ingabe, and orange is cable.
Everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green with each other and you can quickly build larger circles.
They add a blue to a green, and they can make light.
You can insert a dazwish switch and so you have created a small dimmer.
Take them the schalter out about a pulsmodule, which is here, insert, and they have made a small blinker.
Add it to this buzz for an additional effect and you have a noise machine made.
I will stop it.
over the simple play out, is littlebits actually quite leistungsstark.
Instead of that man programming, verdrahten or löten must, let littlebits program with simple, intuitive gestes to program.
um also das blinken to accelerate or zu verlangsamen, drehen them simply on this knopf and er makes the impulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littlebits is that it is a growing library.
We want to bring each individual interaction in this world into a useful stone.
lichter, töne, solar elements, motors — everything should be available.
We have littlebits an kids verteilt and see them play with it.
And it was an incredible experience.
The most beautiful is how they start the electronics, which they im alltag surround to understand and which they don’t learn in the school.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why the türen des aufzugs offenbleiben, or how an ipod reacts to touch.
We have also brought somelebits to designschulen.
We also had zum beispiel designer with keinerlei experience in electronic things that begin, with littlebits as material to play.
here we see , mit filz , paper and wasserflaschen , like geordie ...
vor a few weeks have we littlebits zu risd brought and gaben them some designers who had no technical experience - only carton , holz and paper - and sagten them : &quot; power was . &quot;
Here is an example of a project that they make, a movement-gesteuerte confetti-kanone.
But wait, this here is really my favourite project.
It is a hummer from the knete, the fear in the darkness has.
For these non-engineers, it was littlebits another material, and electronics simply became another material.
And we want to make this material available to everyone.
It is also open source.
You can go to the website, runterladen all the designvorlagen and make them yourself.
We want the world of the erschaffer, the inventor, the non-effective ermutigen, for this world, in which we live, this interactive world, belongs to us.
So, take them out and catch them in to inherit.
A lot of thanks.
