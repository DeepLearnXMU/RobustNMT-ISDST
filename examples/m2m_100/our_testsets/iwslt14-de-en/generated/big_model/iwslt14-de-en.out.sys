You know, one of the great pleasures of travel and one of the pleasures of ethnographic research is to live together with those people who can still remember the old days, who still feel their past in the wind, touch them on rocks smoothed by the rain, taste them in the bitter leaves of plants.
Just knowing that jaguar shamans still travel beyond the Milky Way or the meaning of the myths of the oldest Inuit are even more meaningful, or that in the Himalayas the Buddhists still pursue the breath of dharma, means recalling the central revelation of anthropology, that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in an absolute sense, but only as a model of reality, as a consequence of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation that our ancestors, even successfully, chose many generations ago.
And, of course, we share all diesel adaptation needs.
We are all born, we bring children into the world.
We go through the initiation ritual.
We have to deal with the unstoppable separation by death and therefore it should not surprise us that we all produce singing, dancing and art.
But interesting is the unique tone of songs, the rhythm of dances in every culture.
It does not matter whether it is the penan in the forests of Borneo, or the voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the Krieger in the Kaisut-Wüste of North Kenia, the curanderos in the other, or a caravansery in the middle of the Sahara. this is by chance the colleague, with whom I traveled a month ago in the desert. or even a yak-hirte on the hängen des qomolangma, everest, the godmother of the world.
All these people teach us that there are other possibilities of existence, other ways of thinking, other ways of orientation on earth.
And this is an idea that, when one thinks about it, can only fulfill one with hope.
Together, the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life, which envelops the earth and is as important for the well-being of the earth as the biological life network, known as the biosphere.
The ethnosphere can be defined as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations and intuitions, which have been brought about by human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness.
The ethnosphere is the great heritage of mankind.
It is the symbol of all that we are and what we are capable of as astonishingly wise species.
And just as the biosphere was heavily degraded, so was it with the ethnosphere – only at an even greater speed.
No biologist would, for example, argue that 50% or more of all species are on the verge of extinction, as this is simply not true. and yet, this — the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity — hardly corresponds to what is known to us as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity.
And the crucial indicator for this is the extinction of languages.
When each of them was born in this room, 6,000 languages were spoken on earth.
Now, a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a set of grammar rules.
A language is an expression of the human mind.
It is a means by which the soul of a particular culture finds access to the material world.
Every language is like an ancient forest of spirits, a turning point, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages today, while we sit here in Monterey, exactly half are no longer whispered in Kindern’s ears.
They are no longer taught as grandchildren; that is, if nothing is done, they are already dead.
What could be more lonely than being surrounded by silence, being one of the last of your peoples to speak your language, not having the opportunity to pass on the wisdom of your ancestors, or the hope of expecting children?
And yet this terrible fate actually happens to someone somewhere on earth, about every two weeks, because every two weeks an elderly man dies and takes the last silver of an old language with him into the grave.
And I know that some of them say, “Wouldn’t it be a better place if we all spoke one language?” and I say, “Well, let this language be Yoruba.
Let her be Kogi. &quot;
And then they would suddenly realize what it would be like if they could not speak their own language.
Therefore, today I would like to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a short journey through the ethnosphere, to try to make it clear to you what is actually lost.
Now there are some of us who somehow forget that when I say “different possibilities of being,” “truly different possibilities of being are mine.”
Take the example of this kind of barasana in the northwest of the Amazon, the people of the anakonda, believe that they mythologically brought up the milk flow from the east in the bush of holy snakes.
This is a people who do not cognitively distinguish between the colours blue and green, as the heavens are equated to the forest, on which people depend.
They have a strange language and a marriage precept called linguistic exogamy: you have to marry someone who speaks another language.
However, the strange thing about these large houses, where six or seven languages are spoken because of the mixture, is that you never hear anyone who learns a language.
They just listen and then begin to talk.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I’ve ever lived with, who live in the northeast of Ecuador, an amazing people, who first came into peaceful contact in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake.
They threw shiny photos of themselves out of the air, which we would judge as a friendly gesture, while forgetting that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to see behind the face or figure, found nothing and concluded that these were the devil's business cards and killed the five missionaries with the spear.
But the Waorani do not just kill outsiders with the speer.
They stumble through each other.
54% of deaths occurred through drilling.
We tracked the genealogy eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death, and when we questioned the people with post-pressure something about it, they admitted that one of the people had grown so old that he died due to his age and we still killed him with the speer.
But at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forests, which was astonishing.
Their hunters were able to smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine to which animal species it belonged.
In the early 1980s, I was given a truly amazing task, when my professor at Harvard asked me whether I would be interested in going to Haiti and infiltrating the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes and the gift used to make zombies.
In order to give a sense to this sensation, I naturally had to know something about this remarkable belief in water and voodoo is not a cult of black magic.
On the contrary, it is a complex metaphysical worldview.
It is interesting.
If I asked you to list the major world religions, what would you say?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism or whatever.
One continent is always abandoned, because the assumption was that there was no religious belief in Black Africa. of course there was one and voodoo is simply the remnant of those very profound religious thoughts, which surfaced during the tragic diaspora of slavery.
But what makes voodoo so interesting is this lively relationship between the living and the toten.
The living ones give birth to the ghosts.
The ghosts can be summoned from under the great water, responding to the rhythm of the dances, to temporarily displace the soul of the living, so that the acolyth for a short glowing moment becomes a god.
The voodooists like to say, “You whites go to church and talk about God.
we dance in the temple and become gods. &quot;
and because you are possessed, you will be captured by that spirit. how can you be harmed?
See these amazing demonstrations: voodoo-acolytes in a state of trance, covering burning coal without burning, an astonishing illustration of the ability of the minds to influence the body so that it can withstand when put into a state of extreme excitement.
Now, of all the people I’ve met, the Kogi from Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Northern Colombia were the most extraordinary.
descendants of the ancient tyrannical civilization, which populated the Caribbean coastline of Colombia, and as a result of the conquest, this people withdrew to an isolated volcanic massive, rising above the Caribbean coastline.
In a bloody continent, these people were the only people who were not conquered by the Spaniards.
Until today, they are governed by a ritual priesthood, but the training to the priesthood is very exceptional.
The young acolytees are separated from their families at the age of three and four years and locked in a shadowy world of darkness, in stone houses at the foot of the glacier for 18 years. two periods of nine years each, deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in the shoulder of their corporeal mother, they now spend metamorphorically in the shoulder of the great mother.
And during all this time, they are culturally introduced to the values of their society, values that maintain the assertion that their prayers and only their prayers, the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance.
At the end of this amazing initiation, one day they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. and in this crystal clear moment of awareness of the first light, when the sun begins to shine on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract will be confirmed in astonishing splendor. and the priest steps back and says, “Look, it’s really what I told you.
You have to protect it. &quot;
They call themselves older brothers and say that we, who are younger brothers, are responsible for the destruction of the world.
Now that level of intuition becomes very important.
Whenever we think of indigenous and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old rumor of the noble wild, which in its simplification is a racist thought, or, on the other hand, thoreau and say, these people are more connected to nature than we are.
Thus, the indigenous are neither sentimental nor are they weakened by nostalgia.
There is not much room for this in the malaria-related Sümpfen von Asmat or the Cold Wind of Tibet, but they have nevertheless, through time and ritual, formed a mysterious nimbus of the earth, which is not based on the idea of being consciously close to it, but on a far more subtle intuition, the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is inhaled into the human consciousness.
So what does that mean?
It means that a small child from the other who grows up in the belief that the mountain is an apu-spirit who determines his or her fate will become a completely different human being, and have a different relationship to this resource or place, than a small child from montana who grows up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be carried away.
Whether it is a place of residence of a geist or a bunch of erz is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor, which defines the relationship between the individual and nature.
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia and believed that these forests were there to be grown.
This made me a different person than my friends among the kwakiutl, who believe that these forests are the residence of hukuk and the curved celestial snab and the cannibalistic spirits who live at the northern end of the world, spirits who would participate in their hamatsa initiation.
Now, if one begins to consider the idea that these cultures can create different realities, one can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries.
This is a photo I took last April in the northwest of the Amazon.
This is Ayahuasca, from which many have heard, the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire of the shamans.
What makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of this preparation, but its processing. it is really made from two different sources. on the one hand, there are these wooden lians, which comprise a series of betacarbolines, harmin, harmolin, slightly hallucinogenic, birgt. this climbing plant alone is about as if a blauer trüber smoke sits on her consciousness, but it is with the blättern of a strauchs from the family of the coffee plants with the name psychotria viridis vermischt.
This plant contains some very strong tryptamines that are very similar to serotonin, dimethyltryptamine-5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine.
If you have ever seen the yanomami smash this stuff, this substance, which they extract from different species, also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
Snooping this powder is almost like being shot out of a rifle, carved by Baroque paintings and landing on a lake of electricity.
It does not create a distortion of reality, but the dissolution of reality.
I even discussed this with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who initiated the psychedelic field with the discovery of magical mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s. I claimed that this tryptamine could not be classified as a hallucinogen, because in the moment in which one feels the effects, one is no longer there to experience a hallucination.
But the thing about tryptamines is that they cannot be taken orally because they are denaturated by an enzyme naturally occurring in the human intestine called monoamine oxidase.
They can only be taken by mouth in combination with some other chemicals that denaturate the stomach.
Now the fascinating thing is that the beta-carbolins contained in der liane are mao-inhibitors of exactly the kind that is necessary to potentiate the tryptamine.
How can these humans, from a flora of 80,000 species, find these two morphologically unrelated plants, which, when combined in this way, create a kind of biochemical version, so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?
We use this great euphemism, attempt and error, which turns out to be meaningless.
But if you ask the Indians, they say: “The plants are speaking to us.”
So what does that mean?
These tribes, which are cofan, have 17 variants of ayahuasca, all of which they recognize at a great distance in the forest, which appear to our eyes as a species.
And then they are asked how they justify their taxonomy and they say, “I thought you understood something about plants.
I mean, do you know nothing at all? &quot; and I said: &quot;No. &quot;;
So, it turns out that you take each of the 17 variants at full moon and they sing to one in a different tone.
Well, that doesn’t bring you a doctorate in Harvard, but it’s much more interesting than counting endurance.
Now, the problem – the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the indigenous peoples, see it as original and colorful, but somehow limit it to the past, while the real world, i.e. our world, progresses.
So, the fact is that the 20th century, in 300 years, will not be remembered for its wars or technical innovations, but rather as an era in which we were present and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on Earth was either actively supported or passively accepted.
All cultures have repeatedly participated in the dance with new life opportunities.
And the problem is not the technology itself.
The Sioux Indians listened no less to being Sioux, when they gave up arches and arrows, when the Americans ceased to be Americans, when they gave up horses and horse cars.
Not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnosphere . . . it is power . . the ugly face of domination . . .
And wherever one looks around in the world, one will discover that these cultures are not devoted to extinction. these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is suppressed by recognizable forces that go beyond their capacity for adaptation. whether it is the monstrous deforestation in the homeland of the Penan, a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from sarawak, a people who lived freely in the forest a generation ago, and now has been humiliated by slavery and prostitution am flussufer, from where they can see that even the flow with the mud is polluted, which soon appears to be half borneo in the South China Sea, from where the Japanese ships on the horizon are to be seen, who are ready to embrace their schiffs with rohenum baumstämmen, who they hardly know
or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I recently research a lot, you will see the ugly face of political dominance.
You know, the genocide, the physical extinction of human beings is generally condemned, but the ethnocide, the destruction of the way of life of human beings, is not only not condemned, but generally and in many places celebrated as part of a development strategy.
And you can’t understand the suffering of Tibetans if you haven’t experienced it at a lower level.
I once traveled with a young colleague 6000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through Southeast Tibet to Lhasa and only when I came to Lhasa I saw the face behind the statistics of which one hears 6000 sacred monuments, which have been transformed into shuttle and ashes 1.2 million people, who were murdered by the frame during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this young man was identified as a supporter of the Panchen Lama.
This meant that he was immediately murdered during the Chinese invasion.
His uncle fled with her holiness in the diaspora, which brought people to Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned as a punishment for being wealthy.
He was smuggled into prison for two years to hide under her rockzipfel, as she could not live without him.
The sister, who committed this brave act, was taken to an educational camp.
One day she accidentally stumbled onto a bracelet and for this offence she had to spend seven years in a heavy labor camp.
The suffering of Tibetans may be unbearable, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something unforgettable.
Do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity?
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said before she died that it is her greatest fear that while we move towards a fading, gestaltless, generic worldview, we would not only see the entire bandwidth of human imagination reduced to a narrow mindset, but that one day we wake up from a trauma, forgetting that there were ever other possibilities.
And it is humiliating to think that our gattung may have existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolithic revolution, which brought us agriculture, and in this moment subdued us to the cult of the grain, replaced the poetry of the shamans with the prose of the priesthood and hierarchy, specialization and surplus schuf - took place only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it is only 300 years old.
Now, this superficial history does not tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we face in the coming millennia.
When we ask these countless world cultures about the significance of being human, they answer with 10,000 different voices.
And in this song we will rediscover the possibility of being what we are: people with full consciousness, who are aware of the importance that all people and virtues must be guaranteed a space to thrive.
Here is a photo I took at the northern end of the Baffin Islands when I went on a narwhal hunt with Inuits, and this man, Olaya, told me a wonderful story about his grandfather.
The Canadian government has not always dealt very well with the Inuit and during the 1950s, in the wake of the establishment of our rule, they were forced to move to settlements.
The old man’s grandfather refused.
The family, who feared for his life, took away all his weapons and all his tools.
Now you need to know that the Inuit are not afraid of the cold; they used it to their advantage.
The sliding rails of their slits were originally made from fish, which was wrapped in near-haut.
The man’s grandfather was not afraid of the Arctic night or the hurricane.
He slipped out, dropped his seehundsfell hose and defecated in his hand. and when the feces began to freeze, he formed them in the form of a messer.
It sprayed saliva on those sides of the fecal messer and if it was completely frozen, it replaces a dog with it.
He cut off the dog and improvised a dish, took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a slit, strained another dog and wandered over the ice skulls with the fecal knife at the belt.
So you can do nothing out of nothing.
And this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the Inuit and all the natives of the world.
In April 1999, the Canadian government gave the Inuit full control of an area larger than California and Texas combined.
It is our new homeland and is called Nunavut.
It is an independent territory; it controls all minerals.
This is an amazing example of how a nation, a state, can seek and<unk> reconciliation with its inhabitants.
And ultimately, I think, it is quite obvious, at least for those of us who have travelled to these distant souls of the earth, to recognize that they are not at all distant.
They are the homeland of somebody.
They represent to you the human imagination that dates back to past times, and for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the geography of hope.
What we ultimately try at National Geographic is that we believe that politicians never<unk> anything.
We believe that polemics — we believe that polemics are not convincing, but we believe that storytelling can change the world and therefore we are probably the best institution for storytellers in the world.
156 nations are broadcasting our television channel.
Our newspapers are read by millions.
And we undertake a series of trips into the ethnosphere, during which we take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they are blinded by what is seen. and hopefully, one by one, they will accept the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in different ways, that we can find a possibility of living in a truly multicultural pluralist world, where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our common well-being.
Many thanks.
What I will show you first, as soon as possible, is the basic work, a new technology that we handed over to Microsoft as part of an acquisition exactly a year ago. that is seadragon. and it is an environment in which they can either locally or remotely deal with huge amounts of visual data.
We see many, many gigabytes of digital photos here, which one can seamlessly and continuously rearrange in any way.
And it doesn’t matter how much information we look at, how big these collections are, or how big the images are.
Most of them are digital photos of a camera, but this one here is, for example, a scan from the Congress Library and it is within a range of 300 megapixels.
It makes no difference, because the only thing that can limit the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time.
This is an entire book, an example for non-image data.
This is the bleak house of Dickens, every column is a chapter.
In order to prove that it is really a text and not an image, we can do something like tun to really show that this is a real representation of the text and not an image.
Per<unk> this is an artificial art of reading an e-book.
I<unk>’t recommend it.
This is a more realistic case. - This is an expense of the guardian.
Every big picture is the beginning of a paragraph.
And that really gives them the pleasure and good experience of reading a real paper edition of a magazine or newspaper, which in itself is an art medium of several sizes.
We have also done something at the corner of this special issue of the Guardian.
We have designed a fake ad with a very high resolution, which is much higher than a normal ad, and we have added additional content.
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see them here.
other models, or even technical specifications.
And this really grips these ideas to abolish these restrictions on the available space on the screen.
We hope that this no longer means pop-ups and other nonsense – that shouldn’t be necessary.
Of course, mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this.
And I really don’t want to spend much time here, except to say that we will also contribute to this area.
But these are all the streets in the U.S.A.
It is located on the top of NASA's Earth-size image.
Let us find something else now.
It is now even live on the internet. you can check it out.
This is a project called photosynth, which really connects two different technologies.
One is seadragon and the other is a very good research on computer vision, which was done by Noah snavely, a University student at the University of Washington, under the advice of Steve Seitz an der Ihre
And Rick Selsky of Microsoft Research was conducted. a very good collaboration.
So this is live on the internet. it is powered by seadragon.
You can see this when we create this kind of view, in which we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiple resolution.
But the spatial arrangement of the images is in fact of importance here.
The computer vision algorithms have held these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these images, all taken near the grassi lakes in the Canadian rocks, they see here elements of stabilized diapositives or panoramic image processing and these things were all spatially related to each other.
I don’t know exactly if I still have time to show you other environments.
There are some that are much more spatial.
I would like to show you directly one of Noah's original datasets and that is from an early prototype of photosynth on which we first worked this summer to show you what I believe is really the point behind this technology, which is photosynth technology. and this is not necessarily so obvious when you consider the environments we have on the website.
We would have to worry about the lawyers, etc.
This is a reconstruction of the Cathedral of Our Lady, which took place exclusively in the computer with images from Flickr. just enter our lady in Flickr and you will get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university terrace, etc. Each of these orange kegles represents an image that was discovered as belonging to this model.
So these are all flickr images, and they are all spatially related to each other in this way.
And we can navigate in this very simple way.
You know, I never thought I would eventually work with Microsoft.
I am very grateful for the reception here.
I suspect, you can see that these are many different types of cameras: everything is there, from the handheld camera to the professional slrs, a fairly large number of them, all of which have been combined in this environment.
And if possible, I’ll find some of the strange ones.
Many of them are covered with usw.
Somewhere here are a series of photographs – here they are.
This is actually a poster by Our Lady, which was properly recorded.
We can switch from the poster to a physical view of this environment.
The point here is that we can do things with the social environment. there are now data collected from everyone - from the entire collective storage of how, visually, the earth looks - and everything is connected.
All these photos are linked together and there is something that is greater than the sum of yours.
You will get a model that emerges from all over the earth.
Consider this as the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawlers an virtual earth.
And this is something that grows due to the complexity with which people use it, and its benefits for the user with the application become ever greater.
their own photos are painted with metadata, which was entered by another person.
If someone who has worked hard has labeled all these saints and told them who they are all, then my photo of the Notre Dame Cathedral is suddenly enriched with all these data and I can use them as a starting point to dive into this room, into this metaverse, which uses photos of other people and thus makes a kind of overgreifender modaler social experience with the use of other providers.
And of course, a by-product of all this are the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, which were not only obtained through overflights or satellite images and so on, but through collective storage.
Many thanks.
Does their software allow that at a certain time, within the next few years, all images shared by someone in the world are linked to each other in principle?
He does nothing but discover.
If you want, create hyperlinks between the images.
And she does this because of the content in the images.
And that’s really exciting when you think of the abundance of semantic information that many of these images possess.
like when you do a web search for images, where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about which image it is.
But what if the picture connects her with all of her pictures?
then the scope of the semantic interconnection and the abundance resulting from it is really enormous.
Blaise, that’s really incredible. sweet congratulations.
You have a lot of thanks.
I will tell you a few things from my book that, I hope, are in harmony with other things that you have already heard, and I will try to make a few connections for yourself if you do not notice them.
I would like to start with them, was I &quot;official dogma &quot;none.
The official dogma of what?
The official belief of all western industrialized societies.
The official dogma works this way: if our soul is the maximization of the common good of our citizens, this is primarily through the maximization of the freedom of the individual.
The reason for this is that freedom in itself is good, valuable, meaningful, an indispensable prerequisite for humanity.
When people have freedom, then each of us acts for himself to do the things that maximize our common good and no one has to decide for us.
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choices.
The more choices people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more common good they have.
This is, I think, so deeply embedded in our water supply that no one in that sense would come to question it.
It is also deeply rooted in our lives.
I will give you some examples of what has made modern progress possible.
This is my supermarket, not a big one.
I would like to say a few words about saladdressing.
There are 175 dressings in my supermarket, if you don’t count the 10 different extra olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar you could buy to create a large number of your own salad dessins, in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the laden for you is right.
That’s how the supermarket is.
and then go to the consumer electronics store to assemble a stereo — speaker, CD player, cassette player, radio, amplifier. and in this one electronics store there are so many stereo devices.
We can assemble 6.5 million different stereo systems from the components offered in this one store.
You have to admit that this is a huge selection.
In other words, the world of communication.
There was a time when, when I was a boy, one could have one telephone provider that one wanted, as long as he was from my bell kam.
They rented their phone, they didn’t buy it.
One consequence was that the phone was never broken.
These days are over.
We now have almost an endless selection of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is der in der nicht – mp3-player, nose-haar-trimmer and crème brûlée fackel.
And if you haven’t seen this in your business before, you can be sure that you will soon.
And what it does is it makes people run into the business and ask this question.
Do you know what the answer to this question is?
The answer is &quot;No. &quot;
It is not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn’t get too much tut.
In other aspects of life, which are much more important than the purchase of items, the same explosion of choice occurs.
health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them what to do.
Instead, they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them: we could do a or we could do b.
It has these advantages and risks.
b has these advantages and risks. what do you want to do?
And they say, "Doctor, what should I do?" &quot;
The doctor says, a has these benefits and risks, and b has those benefits and risks.
What do you want tun?
And if they say, “If you were me, doctor, what would you do?”
The doctor says, “But I’m not her.”
The result is – we call it “patient autonomy” – that sounds like a good thing, but in reality it is a shift of the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something – namely the doctor – to someone who knows nothing and is most likely sick and therefore not in the best condition to make a decision – namely the patient.
There is a huge marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me, which, when you think about it, makes no sense at all, because we don’t buy them.
Why do they advertise about us when we can’t buy?
The answer is: they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change in the prescription.
Something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice, how this folly should show.
We do not inherit identity, we invent it.
And we invent ourselves as often as we want.
This means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
In terms of marriage and family, there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everyone had one and that they married as quickly as they could, and then had children as quickly as they could.
The only true choice was who, not when, and not what they did thereafter.
Nowadays everything is easy to have.
I teach wonderful, intelligent students, and I give them 20 percent less work than I did before.
Not because they are less clever, not because they are less careful.
It’s because they’re busy with other things, they’re asking themselves, “Should I get married or not?”
Should I get married later? should I first have children, or should I only make a career? &quot;
These are all engaging questions.
And they will answer these questions regardless of whether that means doing all the tasks I assign them and not getting a good note in my course.
And in fact, you should do that. these are important questions to be answered.
work -- we are blessed, as Carl has highlighted, with the technology that allows us to work every minute from any tag, from any place on the planet -- except at the Randolph hotel.
There is, by the way, a corner, about which I will not tell anyone, where the wirelesslan works.
I will not tell you because I will use it.
So what does it mean, this incredible freedom of choice we have in relation to work to make decisions, again and again and again, whether we should work or not work.
We can watch our child play football, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our blackberry on the other hip, and our laptop probably on our shoulder.
And even if they’re all off, every minute we look at our child while it’s playing a football game, we also ask ourselves, “Should I accept this call?”
Should I reply to this email? should I write this letter? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is “no,” it will<unk> shape your child’s football experience very differently than it would have been.
Everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle, life is a matter of choice.
And the world we lived in looked like that.
There were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choices.
And the world we live in now looks like this.
And the question is, are these good or bad news?
the answer is &quot;Yes &quot; .
We all know what’s good about it, so I’ll talk about what’s bad about it.
All these choices have two effects, two negative effects on humans.
One effect, paradoxically, is that it is paralyzed instead of liberating.
With so many options to choose from, it is very difficult for a person to make a decision at all.
I will give you another drastic example of this, a study on investing in voluntary pensions.
One of my colleagues had access to investment records from Vanguard, the giant fund company of approximately one million employees and approximately 2,000 different jobs.
And what she found was that for every 10 investment funds that the employer offered, the share fell by 2 percent.
They offer 50 investment funds an -- 10 percent fewer employees take part than if they only offered 5 . why ?
Because there are 50 investment funds to choose from, it is so difficult to decide which one to choose that they postpone it for tomorrow.
And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course, never comes.
Understand that this not only means that humans have to eat dog food when they retire because they don’t have enough money to put back, it also means that making decisions is so difficult that they miss large investment offers from their employers.
By not participating, they give up to $5,000 a year to the employer who would have been happy to increase their contribution.
Lähmung is a consequence of too many options.
And I think it worries that the world looks like this.
You really want to make the right decision, if it is for eternity, right?
They do not want to choose the false investment fund, or even the false saladdressing.
The other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision, we end up less satisfied with the outcome of the selection, than if we had the opportunity to choose between fewer options.
There are several reasons for this.
One of them is conditioned by the large selection of different salad dressings when you buy one, and it is not perfect -- and which salad dressing is already perfect? it is easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what happened is that this imagined alternative leads you to regret the decision, and this regret negatively affects the satisfaction you had of your decision, even if it was a good decision.
The more options there are, the easier it is to regret nothing at all that is disappointing for the choice they make.
Secondly, what economists call the unity cost.
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning by telling us how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare them to.
Well, if there are a lot of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine attractive features of alternatives that exclude them, which makes them less satisfied with the alternatives they have chosen.
For those of you who are not New Yorkers, I apologize.
But here’s what you should have thought.
Here are a few on the Hamptons.
Very expensive properties.
beautiful beach . toller tag . they have it all for themselves .
What could be better? &quot;Verdammt &quot; der Mann denkt, &quot;It’s August.
Everyone in my Manhattan neighborhood is gone.
I could park right in front of my house. &quot;
And he spends two weeks thinking that he has missed the opportunity, tag over tag, to have a great parking lot.
Operation costs reduce the satisfaction we get from our selection, even if what we have chosen is fantastic.
And the more options there are, the more attractive features of this selection will be taken into account in the unit cost of operation.
Here is another example.
Well, this cartoon makes some statements.
He makes a statement about living in the now and<unk> also about doing things slowly.
But an important point that he has power is: Whenever they decide to do one thing, they decide not to do other things.
And these other things may have many attractive qualities, and it will make what they do less attractive.
Drittens: Escalation of expectations.
This struck me when I wanted to exchange my jeans.
I wear jeans, almost all the time.
And there was a time when there were only one kind of jeans, and they bought them, and they fit badly, they were incredibly uncomfortable, and when they wore them long enough and washed often enough, they started to feel “OK”.
So I went to buy new jeans after many years of the tragens of the old, and I said, &quot;I would like a pair of jeans, here is my size. &quot;
And the seller said, "Do you want a slender, lightweight, or wide?
Do you want knöpfe or reißverschluss ? stone or acid washed ?
Do you want jeans with löchern?
you would like below wide-cut, curly, blah blah blah ... &quot;and so on told er.
My kefir was down and after I got up I said, “I would like the art that was once the only art.”
He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying all these damn jeans, and lost the business — and I tell you the truth — with the best fit jeans I ever had.
All this selection allowed me to have it better.
But I felt worse.
I wrote an entire book to try to explain it to myself.
There was a reason why I felt worse, with all these available options, my expectations for what a good pair of jeans could do went up.
I had no concrete expectations, if they only existed in one art.
if they came in 100 species, damn, one of them should have been perfect,
And what I got was good, but it wasn’t perfect.
And so I compared what I had received to what I expected, and what I had was disappointing compared to what I expected.
The addition of opportunities to people’s lives inevitably increases people’s expectations about how good these opportunities will be.
This leads to less satisfaction with the results, even if the results are good.
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this because, if they were, they<unk>’t all know what it’s about.
The truth is more like this here.
The reason is that before everything was better when everything was worse, when everything was worse, it was possible for those people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
Today, in the world in which we live – we wealthy, industrialized citizens, with perfection as an expectation – the best thing for which one can hope is that things are as good as one expects of them.
They are never pleasantly surprised because their expectations, my expectations, are high.
The secret to happiness – that’s what they all came for – the secret to happiness are low expectations.
I would like to say — a short autobiographical moment — that I am married to a woman, and she is really very wonderful.
I couldn’t have done it better. – I didn’t give up.
But settling down is not always such a bad thing.
Ultimately, one consequence of buying a bad-seated jeans when there is only one way to buy it is that if you are dissatisfied and you ask yourself why, who is responsible, the answer is clear. the world is responsible. what could you have done?
When hundreds of different types of jeans are available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who is responsible?
It is equally clear that the answer to this question is: you.
You could have done better.
With 100 different types of jeans in the window, there is no excuse for faults.
And so, when people make decisions, and even if the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about it, they blame themselves.
Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.
I believe one significant—not the only, but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experienced that are disappointing because their standards are so high. and then, if they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think it would be their fault.
And so the result of the balance sheet is that we generally feel better, objective, and we feel worse.
So let me remind you.
This is the official dogma, one that we all believe is correct, completely false.
There is no question that some selection is better than no one, but it does not follow that more selection is better than some selection.
There is a magical thing, I don’t know what it is.
I am pretty sure that we have missed this point for a long time in order to improve our public good.
Now, as a basic question -- I'm fast done -- as a basic question, which is a matter of thought. that was all this choice made possible in the industrialized societies, is there material wealth.
There are many places in the world, and we have heard of many of them whose problem is not the too large selection.
Their problem is that they have too little.
So the things I’m talking about are a strange problem of modern, rich, Western societies.
And what is so frustrating and annoying is: Steve Levitt told you yesterday about how these more expensive and difficult to install childrenitze do not help.
What I tell you is that these expensive, complicated decisions – it’s not easy that they don’t help.
It even hurts.
They worry that we are worse off.
If something of what allows the people of our society to make decisions was shifted to those in which people have too little choice, not only would the lives of people be improved, but our lives would also be improved.
Economists call this a pareto-improving application.
Income distribution will make sure that everyone is better – not just the poor – because all this great selection plagues us.
In conclusion, please read this cartoon, and, a highly developed person, says, "Oh! what does this fish know?
you know there is nothing possible in this goldfischglas. &quot;
A poor imagination, a short-sighted view of the world – and that’s the way I first read it.
But the more I thought about it, the more I came to the view that the fish knows something.
For the truth is that if you break the goldfish glass, so that everything is possible, you have no freedom.
When you break the goldfisch glass, so that everything is possible, you lower the satisfaction.
They increase the paralysis and lower the satisfaction.
Everyone needs a glass of goldfish.
This is fast with absolute certainty too limited—per<unk> also for the fish, definitely for us.
But being absent from a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster.
Thanks to you vielmals.
You know, I’ve talked about some of these projects before, about the human genome and what it could mean, and about the discovery of new groups of genes.
In fact, we are starting from a new point: we have digitized biology and now we are trying to move from digital code to a new phase of biology by shaping and building new lives.
We’ve always tried to ask important questions.
It is something I believe that many biologists have tried to understand, and that at different levels.
We have tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimum components.
When we sequenced the human genome, there was a shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers.
Now we try to ask, can we regenerate life or can we create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, mycoplasma geitalium, which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the laboratory, and we have tried whether we can<unk> this with an even smaller genome.
We have managed to overcome about a hundred genes out of the 500 or so that are here.
But if we look at this metabolic map, which is very simple, compared to ours. trust me, that is simple. but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one by one, it is very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell.
So we decided that the only way forward is to actually synthesize this chromosome which allowed us to vary the individual components and thus ask some of these fundamental questions.
So let’s start with the question, can we synthesize a chromosome?
Does the chemistry make it possible to create these really large molecules what has never been done before?
And if we can, can we start the chromosome?
A chromosome is, by the way, just a piece of inert chemical material.
Our steps in digitalizing life have been exponential.
Our ability to write genetic code has developed very slowly but still increased . and our last point would now put on an exponential curve .
We started it 15 years ago.
It actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we made the first experiments.
As it turned out, DNA synthesis is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can recover small pieces of DNA, 30 to 50 letters long but it is a degenerative process, so the longer a piece is made, the more errors happen.
So we had to develop a new method with which we could assemble these small pieces and correct the errors.
This was our first attempt, starting with the digital information, of the Phi x 174 genome.
It is a small virus that kills the bacteria.
We made small pieces, made a bug correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it into a bacterium, and the bacterium began to read the genetic code and made viral particles.
The viral particles were then released by the cells and returned and killed E. coli.
I spoke to the oil industry recently and they said they understand this model very well.
They laughed more than you did here.
So we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to go much further. we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome. it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code. so we thought, we built it in cassettes of the size of the virus, which allows us to vary the size of the cassettes in order to understand what the individual components of a living cell are.
Design is the key, and if you want to start with digital information in the computer, this digital information must really be error-free.
When we first sequenced the genome in 1995, the error rate was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
If we had used the original sequence, it would not have been possible to high-size.
One part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and must overlap with other 50-letter pieces in order to build smaller sub-units so that they fit together.
We have built up unique elements here.
You may have heard that we installed watermarks.
Think about it: we have a four-letter code: a, c, g and t.
These letters encode about 20 amino acids; and here there is a single definition for each of these amino acids.
We can also use the genetic code to write our words, sentences, thoughts.
In the beginning, we only signed.
Some people were disappointed that it wasn’t poetry.
We constructed the pieces so that we could simply break them down with enzymes. there are enzymes that repair them and re-fuse them.
And we began to make pieces, starting with pieces that contained five to seven thousand letters, attached them to each other by making 24,000-letter pieces to reunite them again, up to 72,000.
In each step, we have produced these pieces in excess so that we can sequence them, because we tried to create a very robust process that they will see in a minute.
We have tried to get to the point of automation.
So, it looks like a basketball play-off.
If we reach these really large pieces – with over 100,000 pairs of bases – then they will not simply grow into e. coli . it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we attach mechanisms to each other .
We know of a mechanism called homologous recombination, which is the mechanism used by biology to repair DNA that can merge such pieces together.
There is an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that survives three million rad radiation.
They see in the upper field that his chromosome simply breaks apart.
Twelve to twenty-four hours later, everything has come back together as it was.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be completely dehydrated, they can even live in a vacuum.
I am absolutely sure that life in space can exist and move in search of aquatic conditions.
In fact, NASA has shown that there are a lot of them out there.
Here is a fusion of the molecule that we have produced using these processes - in fact, we have only used hefe mechanisms with the correct design of the pieces we have put them in . hefe then automatically joins them together .
This is not an electron microscope, it is a regular microscope.
It is such a large molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope.
These are recordings over a duration of 6 seconds.
This is the publication we have just recently completed.
It is the largest molecule with a defined structure ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight of over 300 million.
If we printed it with a scripture size of 10 and without spaces, it would contain 142 pages, just to print out this genetic code.
Now, how do we start a chromosome? how do we activate it?
Obviously, it is very simple to deal with a virus; it is much more complicated to deal with bacteria.
It’s just as easy to do it in eucaryotes as we are tut: you just take the nucleus out and put another inside, and that’s exactly what they’ve all heard about cloning.
In archaebacteria, the chromosome is integrated into that cell, but only recently we have shown that one can complete a transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it.
We cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . roughly, these two are as far away from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes so that we could select this chromosome . we broke it down with enzymes to destroy all proteins . and it was very amazing if we put it in a cell - and they will appreciate our very mature graphics here -
The new chromosome went into the cell.
We actually thought that this was the end, but we tried to bring the process a little further.
This is the main mechanism of evolution here.
We find all types of species here that have embraced a second chromosome or a drittes from somewhere, each time adding thousands of characteristics in just one second to one species.
Thus, people who imagine evolution as a gene that is being altered at a time have missed much of the biology.
There are enzymes called restrictive enzymes that actually digest DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell has no; the chromosomes that we inserted have already been inserted.
It was expressed in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, it was digested and so we had only one cell with a new chromosome.
It turned blue because of the genes we had inserted.
And after a very short time, it had lost all the characteristics of the species and completely converted into a new species based on the new software we put in that cell.
All the proteins changed, the membranes changed – when we read the genetic code, it was exactly what we transferred.
It may sound like genomic alchemy, but by shifting the software DNA, we can change things quite dramatically.
I have argued that this is not the Genesis -- that is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution.
And I have argued that we may be creating a new form of the Cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new species formation based on this digital design.
Why should we do that?
I think it’s quite obvious in terms of what we need.
We are growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years.
To put it in my context: I was born in 1946.
Today there are three people on this planet for one who existed in 1946; within 40 years there will be four.
We have problems with food, fresh and clean water, medicine, fuel for 6.5 billion people.
It will be a challenge to offer this for 9.
We need more than five billion tons of coal, 30 plus billions of fatters of oil, which is a hundred million fatters am tag.
If we think about biological processes or any process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, there is all the CO2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere.
We now have, from our discoveries from all over the world, a database of about 20 million genes, and I would like to believe that these are the design components of the future.
The electronics industry had a dozen components and see the diversity that came from them.
Here, in the first place, we encounter the boundaries of biological reality and that of our imagination.
Today, we have technologies based on these fast synthesis methods to do what we call combinatoric genetics.
We now have the opportunity to build a huge robot that can restore millions of chromosomes.
If they imagine these 20 million different genes to be recovered, or these processes to be optimized to recover the octane, or medically new vaccines, we can change more molecular biology with a small team than in the last 20 years science.
We can select by viability, production of chemicals or fuel production, vaccine production and so on.
this is a recording of real design software in which we work, with which one can actually settle and design new species on the computer.
They know, we don’t necessarily know what it will look like. we know exactly what their genetic code will look like.
We are now focusing on fourth generation fuels.
you have recently seen but to ethanol what is just a bad experiment is.
We have second and third-generation fuels that will come out relatively soon that will have much higher sugar values, such as octane or different types of butanol.
But, as we think, the only way in which biology will have a big impact without further increasing the cost of food or limiting its availability is when we see CO2 as the starting material, and therefore we work on cells that go that way.
And we think we will be the first to use fourth-generation fuels, and that in about 18 months.
Sunlight and CO2 are one method --
But in our discovery of the world, we have all sorts of different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep sea, approximately one-and-a-half miles deep, at almost cooler water temperatures.
CO2 is converted into methane by using hydrogen as an energy source.
We will examine whether we can use stored CO2, which could easily be brought to production sites, convert the CO2 into fuel, in order to trigger this process.
Within a short period of time, we believe we could be in a position to solve one of the fundamental questions of life.
You know, we really have – moderate goals as the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry. if you could not do that with Ted Tun, where else – to become a major source of energy.
But at the same time, we are currently working on using the same approaches for the development of vaccines.
You have seen it this year with the flu, we are always a year behind and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that can be changed by creating recombinant vaccines in the vorhinein.
This is how the future might look with changes, today the evolutionary tree can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria, archae, and possibly eucaryotes.
Our soul is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that.
At the last Ted conference, I gave an introduction to the LHC.
And I promised to come back to explain to you how the machine works.
And for all those who were not there then, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever undertaken – 27 kilometers in diameter.
His task is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe — and that up to 600 million times within a second.
It’s just stunningly ambitious.
This is the machine below Geneva.
We take pictures of this mini-urnal in the detector.
This is called the Atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width, 22 meters in the throughmesser.
Here is a spectacular picture of the atlas in construction so that you can see the proportions.
On the 10th of September last year, the machine went off for the first time.
This image was taken by Atlas.
It caused immense jubilation in the control room.
It is an image of the first radiant particle that travelled the entire distance around the LHC, then intentionally collided with a part of the LHC, to leave a regen of particles on the detector prasseln.
In other words, when we saw this picture on September 10, we knew that the machine was working, which is a great triumph.
I don't know if this caused the greatest joy, or if someone visited the Google site and found the home page so.
It means that we have achieved a cultural influence alongside the scientific one.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here—these golden wires were here.
These wires lead 13,000 ampere when the machine runs at high power.
Now, the engineers among them will look at them and say, “No, they don’t do that.
They can afford this, because if you cool them very wide, they become supra-leaders.
At minus 271 degrees also, the basement as the space between the stars, these wires can withstand that tension.
In one of the connections, between over nine thousand magnets in the LHC, there was a manufacturing defect.
As a result, the wires heat up slightly and 13,000 ampere suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
This was the result.
All this is even more impressive if you imagine that the magnets weigh more than 20 tons and are shifted by about 30 cm.
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.
And they had to remove what we did.
We conditioned them, we repaired them.
Now they are all on their way back.
By the end of March, the LHC will be functional again.
We are going to catch it, expecting to be able to collect the first dates in June or July, and set up our journey fortress to find out what the building blocks of the universe are.
Now, of course, in a way such accidents once again spark the debates about the value of science and engineering at such borders.
I think the fact that it is so hard, the fact that we reach beyond our borders, forms the value of things like the LHC.
I will leave my final words to an English scientist. humphrey davy, who, as I suspect, when he defended the useless experiments of his students, his disciple was michael faraday, saying: "Nothing is more dangerous to the development of the human mind than assuming that our scientific ideas are final, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer."
Many thanks.
I am a writer.
Writing books is my job, but of course it is more than that.
It is also my great, lifelong love and fascination.
And I don’t expect that to change.
However, something strange has recently happened in my life and career, which has led me to completely rethink my relationship to this work.
This peculiar event was that I recently wrote a book – a biography called “Eat, Pray, Love” – which, completely different from all my previous books for some reason, went in the world and became a major mega-event, an international bestseller thing.
The result is that no matter where I come, I will be treated as if I were devoted to destruction.
Seriously, the destruction is devoted to them!
For example, they come to me very concerned and say, “Do you not fear that they will never surpass this success?
Are they not afraid that they will continue to write their whole life and never again create a book that interests anyone in the world?
Okay, that really makes courage.
However, it would be worse if I did not remember that more than 20 years ago, when I first told you as a teenager that I wanted to be a writer, I was faced with the same kind of anxiety reaction.
The people said, “Are you not afraid to never succeed?
Are you not afraid that the humiliation of an abolition will kill you?
Do you not fear that you will pursue this craft throughout your life and that nothing will come from it, and that you will die on a scratch of broken dreams – your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failures?”
Approximately, you already know.
The short answer to all these questions is: “Yes.”
Yes, I’m scared of all these things.
And I always had it.
And I’m afraid of a lot more things that no one would have guessed.
like algae – and other scary things.
But when it comes to writing, I have recently thought about it and wondered: why?
Is that reasonable?
Is it logical that someone should be expected to be afraid of doing the work to which he feels called?
And what exactly happens to the creative enterprises that they make us uncertain about the mutual state of mind – in a way that other professions do not?
My father, for example, was a chemist and I can remember no situation in his 40 years as a chemist in which it was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist.
with deiner chemiker-blockade, john – how are you going with it?
It just didn’t come before, you know?
But to be fair – the group of chemists over the centuries have not received the reputation of alcohol addicts manic-depressive people.
But not only the writers, but the creators of all genres, seem to have this reputation of being mentally tremendously unstable.
All they have to do is look at the bitter tosses of truly great tosses from the 20th century alone, who died young and often by their own hands.
And even those who did not actually commit suicide seemed to be truly neglected by their talents.
Norman Mailer said shortly before his death in his last interview: “Each of my books has taken me a little further.”
An extraordinary statement that you can make about your life work.
But we do not even shock when we hear someone say something like this, because we have known this kind of statement for so long. somehow we have accepted the perception so verinnerlicht and collectively, that creativity and lust somehow naturally belong together, and that art – in the end – always leads to soul equality.
The question I want to ask everyone here today is: is this idea perfect for them?
Do you feel comfortable with it? because with only one centimetre of distance ... I don't feel comfortable with this perception at all.
I find you abscheulich.
I find it dangerous and I don’t want to watch it be taken over in the next century.
I think it’s better if we encourage our great creative people to live.
And I definitely know that it would be very dangerous for me – in my situation – to start this dark path of supposition so to speak – especially in the circumstances in which I am currently in my career.
That means – you see: I’m pretty young. I’m only about 40 years old.
I may have another 40 years of work in me.
And it’s highly likely that everything I’ll be writing from now on will be evaluated by the world as the work that came after the outgoing success of my last books, right?
I say it straight, because here and now we are all somehow friends – it is highly likely that my greatest success lies behind me.
Oh Jesus, what a thought!
These are the kinds of thoughts that can make someone start drinking gin at 9 a.m. and I don’t want to.
I would rather continue to do this work that I love.
So the question is: how?
After some time of reflection, it seems to me that in order to continue to write, I must design a kind of schützendem psychological construction.
Somehow, from now on, I have to find a way to maintain a safe distance between myself and my very natural stress about how the reaction to what is written will be.
While I have been looking for models in the past year to do so, I have also been looking in the past and I have tried to find other societies to see if they may have better or more reasonable ideas about how to help creative people deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity.
This search led me into ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
Please follow me, because the circle will close again.
But in ancient Greece and Rome, people did not believe that creativity came from people, okay?
They believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant-spirit, coming to man from a distant, unknown source – for unexplained, unknown reasons.
The Greeks called these divine servant spirits of creativity “demons.”
Von Sokrates is known to have believed in it because he had a demon who did not give him wisdom from far away.
The Romans, who had the same idea, called this art of bodyless creative spirit a “genius”.
The Romans did not really think that a genius was a<unk> clever individual.
They believed that a genius was this art of magical divine being, who was believed to live sprichwörtlich in the winds of an artist’s studio – approximately like dobby, der hauself – who came out and in a way invisibly assisted the artist in the work and shaped the outcome of the work.
This is brilliant – there it is, there is the distance from which I spoke – the psychological construction that will protect you from the consequences of your work.
And everybody knew it worked like that, right?
The artist of ancient times was protected from certain things, such as, for example, too much narcissism, right?
If your work was brilliant, you could not look at everything for yourself. everyone knew that you had this bodyless genius that helped you.
If your work flopped – not entirely your fault, right?
Everyone knew, your genius was a bit lazy.
The people of the West have been thinking about creativity for a long time.
And then came the Renaissance and everything changed. we had this great idea. and this great idea was: let's put the human individual in the center of the universe - above all gods and mysteries. and there is no more room for mystical creatures, who command from the divine assumption.
It is the beginning of rational humanism and people began to believe that creativity came entirely from their own individual.
For the first time in history, people are heard calling this or that artist a genius – instead of having a genius.
I have to tell you: I think that was a big mistake.
I think, allowing a mere person to think that he or she is like the vessel, like the beech and the essence and what of all the divine, creative, unknown, infinite mysteries is a little too much responsibility to raise it to a fragile, human psyche.
It’s like asking someone to swallow the sun.
This distorts and distorts whole egos and creates all these unattainable expectations of success.
I think that this success-print has destroyed our artists over the past 500 years.
And if that’s true – and I think it’s true – the question is:
Can we change it?
Per<unk> to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between man and the mystery of the creative.
Per<unk> not.
Per<unk> we can’t just wipe out the thoughtfulness of 500 years of rational humanism in a 18-minute talk.
And there are<unk> people in this audience who would raise genuinely justified scientific doubts about the idea of – basically – fairies, who apply human succession and feenzauber to their projects, etc.
I probably won’t be able to take all of you on this trip.
But the question I want to raise is: why not?
Why not think about it that way?
For it makes as much sense as anything else I’ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy, lustfulness of the creative processes.
A process that – as everyone knows who has tried to do something – in other words, everyone here – does not always behave rationally.
In fact, it can sometimes feel quite paranormal.
I recently had such an encounter when I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who is now over 90 years old, but who has been a poet all her life. she told me that when she was working outdoors on the fields in rural Virginia, she said she would feel and hear like a poem about the landscape came upon her.
She said it would be like a darnder zug from the air.
that would rush over the land upon them.
She felt it when it came, because it would make the earth under her feet baby.
She knew that in such a moment she could only do one thing, and that was – in her words – “run like the devil.”
she ran like the devil to the house while being pursued by this poem. it was only because she had to get to a sheet of paper and a pen quickly enough so that she could catch it and hold it on the sheet when it went through her.
At other times she wasn’t fast enough. she ran and ran and ran, but she didn’t reach the house and the poem rolled through her and she missed it. she said it would continue to pull over land and – as she said – “seek another poet”.
And then there were those moments – that part I will never forget – she said there were moments in which she quickly missed it.
So: she runs to the house looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pen just as it passes through her and then – she said – it was as if her other hand grabbed it and tried to pack it.
She grabbed the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it onto the piece of paper.
On these occasions, the poem came straightforwardly and intact on the paper – but backwards – from the last word to the first.
When I heard this, I thought, “It’s terrible – that’s exactly how my creative process runs.”
This is not my creative process at all – I am not the channel!
To be able to work, I have to get up and sweat at the same time every day, and to get upset and really uncomfortable through it.
But even I in my maultierart sometimes have this thing gestreift.
And I think many of you have done that too.
I myself had works or ideas that came through me from a source that I really can’t identify.
What kind of thing is that?
And how do we deal with it without losing our minds about it, but on the contrary, even keeping ourselves mentally healthy?
For me, the best living example is how this can be achieved, the musician Tom Waits.
For most of his life, Tom was the embodiment of the tormented modern artist who tried to control and deal with these uncontrollable creative impulses that dwelt in him.
He told me that one day he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles and then everything changed for him.
He is driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a small fragment of a song, which, as is often the case with inspirations, is hard to grasp for him. and he will have it. it is magnificent. he lechzt afterwards, but he cannot grasp it.
He has no piece of paper, he has no pen, he has no cassette recorder.
So, this old grievance begins to rise in him, such as, “I will lose this thing and will be persecuted by this song forever.
I’m not good enough, I can’t do it.”
But instead of panicking, he just stopped listening.
He finished the whole thought process and did something entirely new.
He simply stared into the sky and said, “Sorry, can’t you see that I’m driving?”
“Do I look like I’m just writing a song?
If you really want to exist, come back at a more favorable time when I can take care of you.
If not, someone else is tormenting today.
“Come on to Leonard Cohen.”
His work process has changed since then.
Not the work itself. it was still often as dark as eh and me.
But the process and the heavy distress that surrounded him had been lifted when he took the genius out of himself, where nothing but trouble was caused, and left him back where he so-called came. he realized that it had not to be a verinnerlichte, tormenting thing.
There could be a peculiar, wundersame, bizarre collaboration, an art of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing, which was not quite tom.
When I heard this story, it also changed a bit the way I worked, and it has saved me once.
This idea saved me when I was in the middle of the writing process of “eat, pray, love.” I fell into one of those graves of doubt in which we all fall when we work on something and it doesn’t work. you start thinking that it will be a disaster.
Not only bad, but the worst of all times.
I started to think I should just start the project.
But then I remembered how Tom had spoken in the open sky, and I tried.
I also lifted my gaze from the manuscript and spoke my comment in the direction of an empty corner of the room.
I said loudly, “Listen, you ding, you and I both know, if this book is not brilliant, that it is not entirely my fault, right?
For you see, I invest everything I have.I have nothing more than that.
So if you want to have it better, you have to cross here and adhere to your share of abmachung.
Okay, but if you don’t do that ... you know you were, then to the hell with it.
I will continue to write, because that’s my job.
And I would like to please record that I was here today for my part of the job.”
Hundreds of years ago, in the deserts of North Africa, people gathered for mondschefests with sacred dances and music, which were held for hours – until dawn.
These parties were always great, because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic.
But from time to time, very rarely, something special happened. one of the actors actually became overworldly.
And I know that you know what I mean, because I know that everyone in their lives has seen such an act.
It was as if that time had stopped and the dancers had struck through a kind of fortress. he did nothing but what he had done before – 1,000 nights before.
Suddenly, it no longer appeared to be human.
It was illuminated from within and illuminated from below, and everything was illuminated by a divine fire.
When such a thing happened then, the people knew that was the war. they called it by his name.
They put their hands together and began to sing, “Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.”
That’s good, you know?
Interesting historical footnote: when the moors conquered southern Spain, they brought this need mit. that pronunciation changed in the course of the centuries from “Allah, Allah, Allah” to “olé, olé, olé”, which is still heard in bullfights and flamenco dances.
If an actor in Spanish has something impossible, something magical getan: “Allah, Oule, Oule, Allah, great, bravo” unfassbar, then it is: a quicker look at God.
And that’s great, because we need it.
But the difficult part follows the next morning, when the dancer himself wakes up and realizes that it is 11 a.m. on a Tuesday – and he no longer carries a little bit of God in himself.
He is merely an alterner mortal with painful knees, and<unk> he will never climb to those heights again.
And<unk> no one will ever again invoke the name of God when he turns around, but what will he do with the rest of his life?
That is hard.
This is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life.
But maybe it doesn’t have to be so much more painful if you didn’t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you.
if they may only believe that they are a loan – from an unimaginable source for a selected time of their lives, which is passed on to someone else when they are done with it.
When we start, then thinking about it, it changes everything.
So I have begun to think, and I think so with certainty in the past few months, as I was working on the book that will soon appear – when the dangerous, frightening, highly anticipated successor of my deceased will happen.
What I always have to say to myself when I get crazy about it is: don’t be afraid.
Do not be enthusiastic.
Just do your job.
Stay there for your contribution, whatever it may be.
If your job is dancing, dance.
If the foolish divine genius who has been put to your side decides to show you a little wonder through your effort for a short moment, then “Ole!”
And if not, dance still your dance.
“Hello!” for you in spite of alledem.
I believe in it and I feel that we should teach it.
“Hello!” for you despite all this, simply because you have the mere human love and the sense of being there for it.
Thank you thanks.
Thank you thanks.
Olé !
Last year I showed these two foils to illustrate that the Arctic ice sheet, which for<unk> three million years had the largest of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent.
But this does not express the seriousness of this particular problem strongly enough, as it does not show the thickness of the demands.
In a sense, the Arctic ice sheet is the beating heart of our global climate system.
It grows in winter and shrinks in summer.
The next folly I’ll show you is a time-traffic recording of what has happened in the last 25 years.
The duration is marked with red.
As you can see, it grows on the dark blue marked; this is the annual ice in the winter; and it shrinks in the summer.
The so-called durereis, five years old or older, is almost like blood flowing out of the body here.
In 25 years, it will be gone from here to here.
This is a problem because the warming on the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, in which there is a large amount of frozen carbon, which, when frozen, is converted from microbes to methane.
Compared to the total amount of climate-changing substances in the atmosphere, this amount could double if we exceed this critical point.
Today, methane has already sprudelt in some bottles seen in Alaska from itself from the washer.
Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has travelled to another place last winter with another working group.
Wow! wow!
You are doing well, the question is how will it happen to us?
One reason is that this enormous heat storage facility warms Greenland from the north.
This is an annual tauwasserflow.
But the volumes are much larger than before.
This is the Kangerlussuaq river in southwestern Greenland.
If you want to know how the sea mirror rises through the landslide, you flies into the sea here.
These streams are flowing rapidly.
On the other end of the planet, Antarctica, the largest ice mass on the planet.
Last month, researchers<unk> that the entire continent now has a negative ice balance.
And the western Antarctic, which has emerged over a few underwater islands, is<unk> strong in melting.
This is equivalent to 20 feet of sea height, like Greenland.
In the Himalayas, the thickest ice mass, you can see new seeds above, which were glaciers a few years ago.
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking washer from this meltwater.
On the other hand, this glacier is the drinking water source for this city.
The quantities of water have grown.
But when they turn out, even most of the drinking water will fall away.
In California, a 40 percent reduction in the snow cover of the Sierra has been seen.
This applies to the storage pool.
And the predictions, as you read them, are serious.
This drying up in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase in fires.
and the disasters everywhere in the world have increased in a truly extraordinary and unprecedented scale.
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 years.
This is a completely unsustainable pattern of development.
If you look at this in a historical context, you can see what it creates.
In the last five years, we have produced 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons a tag in the oceans.
Look closely at the East Pacific region, from the American continent to the west and on both sides of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest single factor for global warming, in addition to deforestation, which accounts for 20 percent, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Beer is a problem, and coal is the biggest problem.
The United States is one of the two largest polluters, along with China.
And the proposal was to build many more coal factories.
But we are beginning to see a change.
Here are the ones that have been shredded in recent years, with some green alternatives that have been proposed.
Despite this, there is a political conflict in our country.
And the coal and oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars last calendar year to promote clean coal, which is already a contradiction in itself.
This picture reminded me of something.
On Christmas Eve, at my house in Tennessee, a billion tons of cohleschlamm came out.
You have apparently seen it in the news.
This is the second largest waste stream in America in our entire country.
This happened on Christmas.
One of the advertisements of the coal industry around Christmas was this.
Frosty der Kohlenmann is a cheerleader, cheerleader.
It is abundant in America, and it helps our economy to grow.
Frosty, der Kohlenmann becomes one day cleaner.
It is affordable and lovable, and the worker remains in wages and bread.
This is the one of the most coal in West Virginia.
The most powerful mountain worker is the leader of massy coal.
Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don’t know what they’re talking about.
So the Alliance for Climate Protection has called for two campaigns to come to life.
This is one, a part of her.
At coalergy, we see climate change as a serious threat to our business.
That’s why we decided to spend a substantial sum of money in order to launch a promotional campaign to tell the truth about coal.
Tatsache is, Kohle is not dirty.
We think it’s clean – and it smells good too.
So don’t worry about climate change.
Leave it quiet to us.
Saueber Kohle, you’ve heard a lot about it.
So let’s take a tour of this modern, clean coal factory.
This machine is pretty sea.
But it is the sound of clean cohletechnology.
And yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming, and the remarkable clean coal technology you see here is changing everything.
Look closely, this is today’s clean coffee technology.
The positive alternative is finally mixed with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.
America is in crisis, the economy, the national security, the climate crisis.
The red faden that connects all of these is our dependence on carbon-based fuels such as dirty coal and foreign oil.
But now there is a bold, new solution to free us from this miserable situation.
America will have 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years
A plan to bring America back to work, to make us safer and to help stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that is big enough to solve our problems.
Find out more about America.
This is the last one.
It’s about an uncertainty of America.
One of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on the old, dirty fuels that suffocate our world.
The future is here: wind, sun and a new energy system.
new investments in order to create well-paid jobs.
It’s time to accept the reality.
There is an old African proverb: If you want to be quick, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together. &quot;
We have to go far, and quickly.
Many thanks.
I would like to start asking you to think back to that time of your childhood, when you were playing with bauklötzen.
As they recognized how to stretch out and access the hands, pick up and move the clothes, they actually learned to reflect and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial connections.
Spatial thinking is closely related to how we understand a large part of our environment.
As a computer scientist – inspired by the art of our interaction with real-life objects – together with my expert adviser Patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi, I began to wonder: what if we would use a computer instead of a mouse-seeker that moves like a digital fingertips on a flat desktop ... ... what if we could intervene with both hands and physically grab the data and arrange it as we want it?
This question was so comprehensive that we decided to explore the answers and developed the objectives.
In short, a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie.
They can be moved by hand, they can perceive each other, they can capture their movements, and they have a screen and a radio receiver.
Much more importantly: they are physical, which is why you can move them like bauklötze only by stretching out your hands and accessing them.
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulating digital data.
And when these tools become more physical and develop a awareness of their movements, recognize each other and perceive the subtleties of our interaction with them, then we can begin to explore new and more entertaining ways of interaction.
I’ll catch up with a few simple examples.
This siftable is configured for video playback and if I slide it in one direction, the video will play forward; if I slide it in the other direction, it will run backwards.
And these interactive portraits realise each other.
So if I put them side by side, it arouses their interest.
If you are surrounded by voneinader, you also notice this and can get a little nervous.
And they also feel their movements and inclinations.
An interesting sequence of interactions that we began to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data, such as shaking colours, like this with fluids.
In this case, we have three siftables configured as colour tapes and I can use them to not pour color in the in there, where they are then mixed.
If we exaggerate, we can back up a little bit.
There are also some clear opportunities in education such as languages, mathematics or logic games, where we give people the possibility of quick testing and want to see the results immediately.
This is a Fibonacci sequence, which I create using a simple equation program.
This is a game with words, which is an art of mixing scrabble and boggle.
In principle, each round is randomly assigned a letter to each table, and while you try to form words, they are checked through a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds, it is mixed again and one has a new combination of letters and new ways to try out.
Many thanks.
These are some of the kids who came on an excursion to the media lab. I could move them there, try it out and I recorded a video of it.
You really loved it.
An interesting aspect of this type of application is that you don’t have to give people many instructions.
All you have to say is &quot;image words &quot; and they know exactly what to do.
Here are a few people who are testing it.
This is our youngest beta-tester down there to the right.
It turned out that the siftables only wanted to stapeln.
So for him, they were merely bauklötze.
This is an interactive trickfilm application.
We wanted to develop a learning tool for language learners.
This is Felix.
It can bring new characters into the scene by lifting the table table that shows this figure.
This is where the sun rises.
The sun is going up.
Now Holt is a tractor in the scene.
The orange tractor.
Good work! yes!
by shaking the siftables and placing them next to each other, he can make the characters interact ...
Inventing his own history.
Hi! hi!
It is a story with an open end and he can decide how it develops.
A flying cat.
The last example, for which I have time today to show it, is a music sequencer for live appearances, which we have recently developed and in which it can be used as tones, such as führungsstimme, bass and schlagzeug agieren.
Each has four different variations; you can choose which one you want to use.
And one can feed these tones into the sequence, which one can in turn arrange in any pattern.
And you eat them by simply holding a tone-siftable on a sequence-siftable.
There are effects that can be changed live, such as hall and filter.
One connects it to a certain tone and then tends it to adjust.
and then overarching effects such as speed and volume, which are applied to the entire sequence.
So let’s look at it.
We begin by feeding the leading voice into two sequence-siftable tables and arranging them in a row, expanding them and adding a little more of the voice.
Now I add a bass to it.
Now I’m going to do a little bit of battle about it.
And now I connect the filter to the batter, so that I can control the effect live.
I can accelerate the entire sequence by turning the pace in one direction or the other.
And now I'm still connecting the filter to the bass; for a little more expression.
I can change the sequence while it runs out.
As a result, I do not have to plan them in advance, but can improvise them; in the meantime, I can extend or shorten them.
And finally, I can hide the entire sequence by shifting the volume-siftable to the left.
Many thanks.
As you can see, my enthusiasm lies in developing new human-computer interfaces that are better suited to how our brains and bodies work.
And today I had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we are working on in our lab.
The idea I want to give you on the road is that we are on the threshold to this new generation of users of interaction with digital media, bringing information into our world that meets our requirements.
Many thanks,
I look forward to the conversations with you all!
Yes, good day.
I am glad that I am there.
So, what is biohacking?
I have to get a bit out of it first, and biohacking is dealing with modern molecular biology.
I am studying molecular biology and have been involved with biohacking for a few years now, and I started because I just wanted to know more accurately and, above all, I wanted to do it myself, which I have learned theoretically in my studies.
That was my primary motivation.
So it was a curiosity and I wanted to somehow get closer to that matter, so.
I think that molecular biology in general now, also very generally speaking, biotechnology, everything that is included, synthetic biology and so on,
It is extremely important, already extremely important, and much, much more important will become in the future.
Because there are such controversial things as these whole genetically modified plants on the eckern.
There is now craig waiting in the U.S.A., who tries to recover biofuel, also algae gasoline.
At the same time, there are already things that have reached everyday, which most people are not even aware of, for example, waschmittelenzyme, which allow us to wash with forty degrees, are also genetically optimized enzymes.
The list can be continued endlessly.
And so, out of interest in this technology, I just went further into it.
So why hack now?
most people know most people know this from the software area.
computer hacking, and then it is always so in the media, yes, the hackers break into somewhere and steal data and so on.
This is somehow very sad for the hacker scene, because it doesn’t really apply to what it actually started like it actually started and what is actually behind it.
The software hackers, in the seventies, eighties, began with computer battle, and the Internet also arose.
And it’s about solving a problem with a playful, creative, original art.
And the problem, this is not only a technical problem, it can also be a social problem, it can also simply be an access problem, which is like simplifying things, also any problem, asking a question, and how to do it differently or how to do it better.
It has just grown up with software, but there is also in the electronics field, there is also a whole bastlerscene that makes all sorts of dangerous things with electronic circuits.
I would like to take this metaphor, which comes from synthetic biology, that biology is actually an information science, because the code is an abstract code, that yes, it is not quite the same as a computer, because it is more dynamic, because it is matter, also real matter, and not just cyber.
But it’s also a code, and you can also program it, and accordingly you can also hack it, so, and I found that I found it incredibly fascinating, and then I just wanted to go much deeper with it.
Only two thousand eight have really taken shape, these networks.
Since there is hackteria dot org, that is, originally from Switzerland, that is, with Europe and with a cooperation in India-based network, which now has members or active people everywhere in the world.
This is a more artistic orientation, so there are many artists and philosophers and, in collaboration with scientists, engaged in dealing with these technologies and asking questions and processing the creative, there are museum exhibitions and yes, everything possible.
But it’s always about finding such a loose approach, having such a playful deal with it.
And then there is do-it-yourself-bio dot org, d.i.y.bio.
This is from the U.S.A. a network, that is actually more like an art forum, where you meet where you stop and discuss online.
They are a little more technical and also a little more business-oriented on the road, then so, yes, applied questions are asked.
And starting from these networks, which have made it all popular, a scene has developed, which I would like to briefly portray.
Here in the picture links above you see biocurious, which is a hacking space, also in principle an art school, so a private school, a public utility association facility, where everyone can get in.
Children, old people, all sorts of people go there just to deal with it, they have set up a laboratory and look at what can be done when these laboratory protocols are followed.
Below is a group in Indonesian, house-of-natural-fibers called die, which has existed for quite a long time.
longer than these other two networks.
They are also engaged in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and, yes, electronics, and combine this in a fairly unusual way.
A group of students from Ankara, whom I met a while ago, who wanted to communicate more to the public, what they learned in the university, and who so did small actions at street parties and tried to explain to people what d.n.a is.
And I have above in on the other picture a lecture in in Copenhagen in the Medical Museum in combination with an exhibition on the subject.
And that is, yes, that is that they are mostly quite young people, but the only thing that was one was actually all united, is this fascination with technology.
And what can you do with it and just go to society with it very specifically and ask, so, okay, what do you know, what do you want to participate, do you have an interest in getting involved with it?
So okay, in order to hack biology now, you need some material.
You need biological materials, of course, and you need tools, and that is a laboratory.
Or, what is normally understood by a laboratory, these are somehow dangerous machines, extremely expensive, extremely remote, only for specialist personnel, trained academics with doctoral degrees, and so on.
And our approach just stopped saying, okay, that you don’t really have to do that.
This is not really necessary, because every coffee machine actually has a higher-degree technology than most laboratory devices, which is really so.
And with this premise, with this premise, then, for example, Brian Degger in England tried to assemble a minimum laboratory, then took such a steam-pressed cooker, a heating plate and, yes, so a soup broth, and then cultivated bacteria, functioning.
So everyone who has ever cooked a soup that has been left standing for too long has already made it.
I then tried this in my laboratory home, a little expand, and then I stopped buying second-hand equipment on eBay and a bit d.n.a. analyzed, tried, a paternity test, so so / d.n.a. fingerprinting, again.
This shouldn’t be a joke at all, but.
Below in the picture you see is the labor, in an introductory strip, so is such an assigned garage with even so many possible laboratory rumpels, which the university has missed out, a group in Paris, which has set up something and is quite successful with it and also does quite interesting things, then I will also cut a project short.
And that here is biocurious, that just also mentioned hackerspace, this yes, so an art volkshochschule in the principle for molecular biology.
And yes, so you see, it is relatively heterogeneous, so there is a stop from people who do this alone at home, to larger and larger organizations that do the more formal already in institutionalized form.
But there is always the idea that it should be simple and accessible.
The first project we did as an international group, when we became almost conscious of ourselves, okay, we are now here as a real scene too, and we are online, and we know the people who always chat and so on.
And then just came from the do-it-yourself-bio org website of the founder, and said okay, we must now really meet, also real meet, and then organized two events, one in London, two thousand ten, and shortly thereafter in the U.S.A, in San Francisco.
And then it went on, who are we, what do we want, what do we want, and what do we want to communicate?
What are our values and what is our goal, our foundation?
And then we developed such a code of conduct.
This was quite intuitive, so everyone has simply expressed his desires, his and what keeps him moving, then.
I have, in my opinion, a very good code in place.
And we have it then that is not binding, but that is stopped yes, I think, has been relatively well implemented, the people are pretty convinced of it.
And then we even tried to bring it back to the academic world, but somehow it didn’t get there.
So I think we, from the biohacker scene, are even one step further in this regard than the academic world.
What kind of projects are we doing right now?
One project that I did with the hackteria-netzwerk in der Schweiz itself was that we wanted to build a so-called optical falle or optical pinzette.
That is, if you focus a laser beam on one in the room, then you can capture small particles in the air or in the fluid and then move in that focus, so that is then caught there, just like such a tractor beamstrahl in principle.
That really works, that’s done in an academic setting, and then we thought, okay, that’s going on, maybe we’ve got a webcam genommen, that’s screwed up, that’s removed, that’s reversed, then you’ve got a microscope that’s enlarged about four hundred times.
You can see it below.
And then we screwed a d.v.d. burner apart and the burner picked up the laser and then tried to focus on that camera there.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work, but we learned a lot.
So another project, that from the French group from Paris, that has worked, that is pretty cool.
And though he has such a yes, such a brainwellenmessgerät, such an e.e.g or something like that, so he has dealt with neurobiology, his nickname is Sam Neurohack.
This helmet was then made, and in cooperation with the museum, it was done.
Then the guests in the room could enter, sit on this chair, put on this helmet.
Then their brain waves were measured, and depending on what they thought or how they thought, then different lights in the room are addressed.
It was a pretty schick project.
Another thing from the U.S., which also has to do with this history of paternity testing, is that of p.c.r, that is, the polymerase chain reaction, a complicated word.
So it’s about copying genes, multiplying, multiplying DNA, multiplying fragments so that they can be made visible.
So if I do this now that the profiles am tatort, then go, collect some hair samples, and then those who apply these then apply this method, and then you can say, okay, this hair belongs to this man, so.
And the machines that make such a thing are quite expensive so, that you buy commercially, the cheapest go so at four thousand euros.
And that’s not in the hobby field, but it’s a really cool technology that can do a lot too.
So this is just one of many applications that can be done with it.
And then there have been two bastlers who have arranged and said, OK, we make it easier and cheaper, and then just from open source, also freely available hardware, electronics, this device has been bundled together and are now those who have even brought it to market maturity and are now the cheapest provider of these devices worldwide.
I think, somehow, six hundred dollars or something like that.
But in any case it’s now it’s still not cheap, but it’s definitely in a framework where it’s still becoming significantly more available.
So it’s my opinion of a very successful hack.
One project I had recently started was to build a gene-gun.
A gene-gun is, yes, like a kind of air-pressure gun, which fires about as far, two centimeters or so.
One loads d.n.a. on gold particles and the gold particles then into this air pressure pistol, and then I shot them on an onion and then brought them to the lighting with it.
So the device that you see, it didn’t work.
But this is so my so my prototype, which, however, has looked quite out of the way, so on such an ast, the thing drauf, electronic drauf and print connected, and that was but the pressure was too high, the thing is broken.
And then I took a playmaker and attached that to it.
If you make it full with a washer, there is enough pressure, so I think, so forty to sixty bars about drauf.
And so you can then accelerate the particles strong enough and then they also go into the onion.
and the commercial device costs about fifteen thousand euros upwards or something like that, the scene spender so about the fifty.
So it doesn’t have the same efficiency, but it’s in principle machbar.
So and that is at the moment that the core concern of the scene is just to increase this availability of technology and also to increase the information and understanding that more people can engage there.
Because, as I said at the beginning, it is an extremely important technology, and most people have relatively little awareness of it and also no chance to get really good at it.
Because, if you only read about it, from secondary literature, it is not the same as if you did or saw it yourself once.
And I think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies.
And if you, as an informed citizen, are also able to make meaningful decisions in society and want to be able to participate, then you need access to knowledge and technology.
And one must also do it and understand it in order to be able to do it and understand it.
This is then firmed under the slogans open knowledge and citizen science.
So that just one as a citizen is put in the position to deal with these scientific technologies.
And that is the core concern of von den biohackern.
These are the people who have at least officially registered on the website, i.e.bio-dot-org website.
This is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide.
Interestingly, they are also present in Southeast Asia.
I believe that there are fewer people registered than they actually exist.
So I know of some who have not registered.
And these are now just the biohackers, the individual people.
Partly also with these hacker spaces, so these locations together registered there.
But that’s at the very beginning.
As I said, two thousand days have only just begun.
and hacker spaces, also the computer hacker spaces, since the c-base in Berlin was the first, nine hundred and fifty-nine.
And this has now become a giant network of very good, yes, infrastructure centers, which are represented all over the world.
And we hope, of course, that we will then stop spreading and then become similarly well connected, so that more people can be involved.
And I would invite everybody once, to deal with it and even try it out for yourself.
It’s not so simple now, but it’s also not impossible, if you have enough curiosity and enough energy, then you get there too far.
Many thanks for listening.
The war &apos; s.
Yes, hello to you.
How do we actually function as humans?
This is a question that has moved me very much as a designer, but also in the field of research usability and above all in the field of user experience.
It is about how to meet people in interactive media, so that they can use these interactive media and so that they can generate the most satisfactory experience possible.
For I believe that the interactive media addresses in us archaic, cognitive models, thus thought patterns, which have been programmed into our biological memory a very, very long time ago, and that we can re-emulate them precisely through interactive media.
And this is very amazing, because one actually believes that this high-tech technology that one encounters actually brings one into the future, but in fact it is so that the future is exactly with us, at our archaic roots.
What are Archaic Models?
I have written four words and would like to explain them briefly.
These are the archaic cognitive models that we used in pre-industrial times.
One of these archaic models is that we have a principally natural relationship to virtuality.
This sounds unusual first time.
But I will go back to it soon and try to prove to you that you also have a natural relationship with virtuality.
The second aspect is that because of these archaic models, we are quite in the position to speak very, very figuratively, although today we use a codified language.
And the third area, which actually explains itself.
We all know that the interactive media is by definition nonlinear, which involves the denial of linearity, and which, of course, tells us that we now perceive linearity as normal.
The fourth point is that history is a place for us to share information.
What about virtuality, which is actually the most natural thing in the world?
I would like to prove this to you.
How many houses does the house in which you live have?
We will not be able to spontaneously answer this, but the following will happen and will happen right now.
They walk in spirit through this house, in dignity they live, and look at how many towers there are.
And that’s exactly what they are doing.
They virtualize reality without a computer.
Fantastic, is it not?
And then we make an effort on the media campus, for example, to present virtual reality in our VR laboratory, while we can actually do so all the time already.
And this ability to virtualize reality by virtualizing reality, the people in the pre-industrial times also needed it bitterly, because they had nothing at all.
They didn’t have any books.
Or they didn’t have a photolitography.
They did not have mass media.
The only thing they had was their head.
And in that head, the memory played off.
In this chapter, knowledge was recalled and, with the help of these virtual images, the imagination, knowledge was just passed on.
And that’s why it’s so deeply rooted in us that we can handle virtuality so well.
The most interesting thing about it is if I can take a little trip.
Yes, that is going.
Interestingly, at that time, man was both a media producer and a medium himself.
If you think a little further now.
What are the media today?
Then you will notice that there has been a change.
But I’ll come to talk about it again soon.
Essential tools of information communication have always been stories.
Shamans, priests, the so-called wissenswachter, were extra restricted in order to preserve their knowledge in stories.
And even today we are still very, very strongly attached to stories.
According to the author of the book The Storytelling Animal, Jonathan Gottschall, we still spend a thousand nine hundred hours a year with the reception of stories.
This means for a child who, until he reaches adulthood, has spent most of his life receiving stories.
Now we think that our love of stories depends on the fact that as a child we sat on the shoulder of our parents.
No, no, far from missing.
This goes much further back, in the cultures of the pre-industrial times.
For me, however, in the field of interactive media, it is<unk> impressive that in itself we have anchored in our biological memory the ability to think nonlinearly.
I have given you an example of the North American tribe of the Nootka Indians.
They lived in the coastal region of British Columbia.
And as you can see, this is a very insular area and one had to navigate there somehow, from insel to insel to get food.
And they did this with so-called lead maps.
You may already know this, if you are a little interested in it, by the Australian ureinwohnern.
They have similar principles.
those who do not have lead maps, but those who have used the so transparent songlines or even traumpfade.
And what is interesting about it is that the navigation and topography of regions could be depicted via songs.
whereas the language is subordinated by subordinate rank war.
That is to say, you navigated through sounds and rhythms.
And these sounds and rhythms have represented the geology, the topography of a region, and that has, of course, also made it possible to defragment these songs and assemble them differently and move so to the left, to the right, and also back to the starting place.
But why don’t we sing anymore to get from above from a to b?
At least not to navigate.
What was actually happening?
That’s what happened in such a machine age.
We have previously moved in the so-called watch age.
The machine age has passed, the book has passed, and the photolitography has passed.
And that’s exactly what happened, that we have shifted the responsibility for our memories and that our own production of our individual memories to external media.
On the book and on the picture.
So, unfortunately, we have learned a bit of virtualization.
Virtuality has suddenly become a stranger to us, and has nothing to do with reality.
Bruce Brown, a well-known design researcher at the Brighton University, has gone so far as to say that these mass media, he means the book and the image, not television, the internet, etc. and so on, what we call mass media today, that these mass media have stinked our memories and erudited our ability to virtualize.
Let’s make a small balance sheet.
From the age of Vogt to the age of machines.
What influences our thinking and our memory?
Then there are the fading influences of the pre-industrial cultures.
Thro<unk> the centuries, they will be more and more overwritten by the influences of the machine age.
That is, instead of remembering ourselves individually, we have standardized, widespread, widespread patterns of memories, on which we can hang our personal memories.
We no longer produce ourselves.
We have an abstract and an abstract language.
We no longer represent things in images, but we codify them in our language.
We have become accustomed to the fact that things happen in a linear way.
We have accepted linearity as a law and there are only exceptions, such as non-linearity.
What remains of us is storytelling.
We are still very, very strongly attached to storytelling as information transmission.
The question is, what is coming now?
We had the Vogt age, we had the machine age, and we are now entering the so-called cyber age.
This sounds very spatial and sounds very much like science fiction, I know.
But these concepts of cyber-age, which bring us these possibilities back to rediscover our abilities.
It is about virtuality, it is about non-linearity, it is about storytelling.
I want to explain it a little bit.
There are technical concepts such as augmented reality, i.e. augmented reality.
So if, for example, Google Glasses anguish, then a concept that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world, that is, our affinity to virtualization, to feel the virtual as something normal, natural, is addressed again.
Another example is the so-called virtual reality.
So crazy that, of course, in the context of my speeches may sound, we move physically in non-existent, virtual worlds, in accordance with the model of the Holodecks.
And another example is the environmental, intelligent systems.
These are spaces that can intelligently react to a human being.
All that requires the ability, our fundamental ability, to accept virtuality as a real living space.
I've graduated and I hope the video works, a very, very nice project mitgebracht, which is the bachelorarbeit of Michael Burk, Ann-kathrin Krenz, Joris Klause and Jan-moritz Müller.
The latter two are still here today.
Maybe you can get up for a moment so that they can talk about the project with the two in the pause.
And I have this project as an example of mitgebracht, as this archaic, cognitive model is addressed again.
This is a game, I have to say.
Storytelling was, of course, extremely welcomed and it is a computer game.
And if I say computer games, then you most likely have seen that some people are happy in front of some console or that they are playing with it with some console in the hand.
In any case, you can get it in.
This is a game for outside.
And this is specifically meant to allow me to explore the outside world, so that I can rediscover the real world.
And this game connects the virtual world, so that data the data space we produce, with the real world.
I apologize for having to abbreviate so strongly.
You can then explain this much better, as there is much more behind it.
And it’s about discovering a city by looking at which places positive or negative tweets have been posted.
And so I get a completely different view of the city, a completely different impression, namely, I see the negative and positive zones of a city and thus obtain in this way a completely different, virtual landscape of a very real city.
And we can now like to anguish at that.
What you can see here, sorry, is a small explanation of what you see right away.
Of course, living in this virtual world in the mausoleum of our cities is clear.
And with an art of pocket lamp, we can make these virtual worlds visible.
So I would like to summarize my talk, in the sense that the qualities and abilities that we have acquired from the twentieth age, and which have gone so slightly away from us in the machine age, that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age, and that in this way, through complex, technological, new products, we do not actually get into the future, but actually come back to our roots.
Many thanks.
Yes, I am very happy to be with you.
I have just been asked if this sack is a speaker sack and will speak instead of mine.
He will not do that.
I will also soon dissolve what is in there.
But until now, I’m still a little bit curious.
Children are naturally curious, or should be curious, as well as designers.
I am a gestalter from the house, so of course I also deal with the theme of curiosity and how that curiosity also changes our thinking again, and why we may also lose curiosity and need to re-engage us, etc. and so on.
This is a whole series of things that one is dealing with in addition to the actual existence as a gestalter.
If professors become curious, then they are often reinstated in such a forschungssemester.
And that’s also what I’ve had in the last half of the year.
A research semester on the topic of natural user interface design.
Now they will wonder why the whole gestalter catches themselves with such natural, archaic forms of communication, interaction, and so on.
And then I keep only one of these small devices up, because those things are meant to become more and more intuitive, more and more natural, more user-friendly, and then one has to stop looking at what is actually natural for us humans, what is user-friendly or intuitive.
And in the background, I have been in the realm of natural user interface design, so the next generation in human computer in there also in relation to human computers is concerned with how our tools or how the computer changes from a computer successively to a digital assistant.
So I’ve been dealing with when it’s natural or intuitive.
Per<unk> you need to take a look at it again.
Why does this happen at all?
So if we look at the development of our society, briefly presented here, then we move now from the third to the fourth society generation or society form.
of the modern in the computer society.
Each society is characterized by a primary medium.
In the beginning, the tribal society was created through the language.
That is to say, one has found one another, by speaking a common language, by being able to communicate with one another, by being dragged into the same cave or into other areas, by having formed cities or villages and by having so "created" a tribal society.
But the primary medium was the language, something very natural, something very vivid.
Although you also had to learn, so no small child can speak naturally, but we learn it successively and relatively naturally.
This was then replaced by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction.
That was a giant scream at the time, because, of course, one began to manifest the living language in the form of writing, that is, what is fluid and living, I catch it and put it in stone and thereby I also manipulate it.
Regardless of how I mixed and when I mixed, it is, of course, a very different reporting, as if there is a living story of itself.
But successively, then, this writing as a primary medium, gained input.
Then came the next generation, in which we actually still live today.
This is precisely the printed and printed writing with Gutenberg and others.
At that time, it was also an affront, where the nobility, clergy and others have said: if you are actually insane, when the people start to read, then they want to talk afterwards and that is, of course, totally fatal.
And now we are coming to the next generation and the exciting thing is, so a change of generation is only every few hundred years and we are at the moment really in this phenomenal phase that we are doing something like that.
This, of course, confuses us altogether, because we see on the one hand the new media, social media, Facebook, etc. and so on.
With total transparency, what the new thinking is, what the old thinking is, don’t say that in the lasagna there is no more horse meat and no more beef or other phenomena, i.e. I want to just hide it and will even reveal it.
And these two worlds are striking each other, new and old thinking.
The exciting thing about this is that, when you look at this, this new society, this computer society, derives itself from very many mechanisms, principles and archaic patterns of thought from those of the stammesgesellschaft.
No longer at the local level, but at the global level.
We understood that the weather is global.
The theme of ecology is global.
If I don’t think locally ecologically and the neighbor thinks less ecologically, then it doesn’t work anymore.
That is to say, the local village has actually become a global village with the same principles, as natural as possible, as intuitive as possible, but also with total transparency.
As it was known in the village at the time, who has what to do with whom and when, so today this expansion of ourselves through these mobile devices is happening at a global level.
It is clear that we know global accumulation and accumulation ever faster and better.
Just like it used to be in the village.
In the background, I have been busy looking at what it really means, what is still natural for us, what we may have learned, what is instinctive for us, so what makes the difference out?
Because people often come, they can’t make them user-friendly, so that everyone can avoid them.
So one has to deal with what it means, and not just change it, that it is different, but it is also to become better.
And, of course, when is something intuitive and how can I, as a designer, influence it and design the things accordingly so that they are a user-friendly, also as intuitive as possible, because then they are fun and easy to use.
Then, even during the course of the study, one deals with the theme of perception and perception psychology.
And that is, of course, also what, where you then start and look and say, okay, now I just look inside myself.
And what does &apos;s actually look like inside?
So how do we work when we get there?
What does it mean to be natural, intuitive, and how do our perceptual channels work and how does cognitive processing work?
As Steve Jobs said, you need to dig deeper to understand how it works.
So you really have to look in detail if I want to make something user-friendly or intuitive, what does that mean?
And then you can see that if you have our seven senses, most think we only have five, now there are even seven recognized, then there will surely be another, eighth sense in the near future, and as an extension of ourselves again.
and to look at how we process information, how do we collect information?
To put it by itself, what is information?
Information is any difference that makes a difference.
Many people use the word but don’t even know what it means in detail.
But I need to understand in the core, in the essence, when information becomes information, when data becomes information, and when information becomes knowledge, so that I know how to make things later as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible.
And of course, also, how the design affects that perception.
If we see this here, if I shape things, then I can shape them confusingly like on the right side, where I do not know what salt and pepper are, or I can shape them almost intuitively by showing things.
So much more natural, though in a container, but I see sozusagen directly, where is salt and pepper in it.
And if I tell somebody, give me salt or pepper, then at the right he will first consider where is what’s in.
And on the left, just intuitively access and then hopefully there is no sugar in it, the salt just give it accordingly.
But also our perception itself, how it deceives us.
For example, this perception in context.
The right circle looks larger than the small one, although this is not the case at all, but they are exactly the same size accordingly, and yet our perception changes depending on the context in which we reset things.
Does anyone know what this is?
As it is.
Pattern recognition should still work.
Then &apos;s already more to my glasses.
So it is &apos;n circle.
A second circle is already beginning to correlate or associate certain similarities.
And if I then stop for another half-walk, then suddenly we no longer see just one more unit, namely a circle, a circle, and, but we see one unit, we no longer see three of you, one circle, one circle, another.
This is called gestaltgesetz, or gestalt psychology, which also influences us in our perceptions.
important for those gestalter, who have it mostly in the first semester, who have great gestaltgesetze.
Gestaltgesetz der Nähe, Gestaltgesetz der Kontinuity and so on.
Often in the shit, then forget again.
But this is an essential component if you want to design things accordingly and as intuitively as possible.
The next phenomenon, which is also very interesting, is that of the seeds.
It sounds quite banal at first, but is also exciting if you take a closer look at it.
So we have the eyes in front and now they think, we see from the front to the back.
That is false.
You can see it from the back to the front.
In other words, they project an assumption forward that they see something that they recognize, for example, a circle.
That is, we first project our sight before we then see it, then bring it backwards into our sighting apparatus, to say, okay,
I have no cognitive back-connection, you have been projected, what you want to see.
This is there, and then it will come back.
Then go forward again, because the back does not believe the front, and say, now really look again and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see.
And then &apos;s go back and back again and then &apos;s is actually only seen.
So a very, very exciting process, how certain things run out and in what for milliseconds-range these things happen.
I don’t know who of you knows this picture.
This is exactly the same thing that I have just described.
Now everyone is trying to recognize something from this pattern.
I don’t know who was admitted.
Does anyone see something specific?
A Dalmatian, for sure.
If I once saw that there is a Dalmatian inside, then you know that.
They will never forget, because I will show them where the Dalmatians are.
Now you see the Dalmatians.
And now, you always see him.
That is to say, I have now actually corrupted them so deeply that they no longer recognize a pattern of dadrin, but I have conditioned them within a short time to see this dog in this confused picture again and again.
And that’s this projection of look, look, look.
Now I know and now I project forward that I can see the Dalmatian.
I see the Dalmatians.
So, very, very exciting processes, which then in this, yes, grey it is not, but here in this rosane the masses just run out accordingly.
Does anyone know what three seconds are?
Long is yes.
This is our present.
So, it’s always interesting to know as a designer.
If I know that something takes three seconds, so to speak, before I get out of the present into the past loop, then I can also very well bridge waiting times, in which I always occupy it by someone with three seconds.
It has to be processed as a present.
Then it wanders into the past and so I can very elegantly overbrücken waiting times, for example on the computer, if I know this phenomenon.
Was it twenty-five milliseconds?
Milliseconds of milliseconds.
It is also a very exciting phenomenon.
This is the zeitraum in which one falls in love.
That means, achtung, if you know this now, pay attention to drauf, wen you look how long, because I take no guarantee for what can then happen accordingly.
and sixteen milliseconds, also a very exciting phenomenon.
This is the time period of most of the perceptions we have.
That is, this first impression occurs at a rapid speed as we perceive things.
And no matter how we see things, what we pay attention to and how we also protect ourselves against our environment, so that we can think about it accordingly.
Of course, the gestalter do not only deal with the theme of perceptions and neuronal processing or cognitive ergonomics, but primarily, of course, with the theme of the human-object-relation.
So how does a human behave with certain things accordingly?
As there is a product language that has practical functions, there are also formal aspects or formalesthetic aspects.
There are anzeichen functions where I know exactly where I really need to grasp.
But there are also symbolic functions, why is there someone for such a small currency, where it was hardly matched anyway, so horrible amounts of money out, even though it is not so practical?
We are, of course, on the symbolic level, on the meaning level, with which we, as gestalter, also deal.
Back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the theme, which, of course, also lies behind, is usability.
Usability always means how to reach a certain soul as quickly as possible or how a user can reach a soul as effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily as possible in a given context of use.
So says &apos;s rather the norm for this.
How can I make something as user-friendly as possible?
I can handle this directly or I need a manual or I need no appropriate training for it.
And it is less usable or user-friendly.
The fact that I only make it differently and more beautiful does not mean that it is better manageable.
This also has to be understood.
And if you look at some of the software we just saw, then you will also understand why ninety-nine percent of our current software is little intuitive or not usable, the i-pad in many domains or the i-phone accordingly included, although it is already substantially more intuitive than classical software.
Intuitive usability is not only an elementary economic factor since Apple, nor an elementary success factor, if I just want to make technological devices useful to humans.
Why Why ?
Because, as a rule, through this new way of usability, i.e. the natural user interfaces, we are, for example, five times faster on average than our soul.
You have to imagine this in such a way that if you do something of the classic software, it will take you five hours and with this new type of natural software only one hour.
This does not mean that they may then be allowed to go home four hours earlier, but their employer or someone else will then realize how they are employed with the four hours accordingly.
But I want to say that for us, of course, it is a corresponding increase in performance to<unk> certain things as well.
If we then go back into the realm of software, here are the first command line interfaces, which were very abstract, where it took months to deal with these systems.
Then came the next ones, who have now worked with not a neural model or a mental model as software ergonomists say, namely, one would have an idea of something, a metaphor, a metaphor of a desktop, to make the computer usable.
So no longer zero and one or cryptic codes, but just a metaphor.
This made it all much more user-friendly, but of course it goes even better.
The next generation of graphic user interfaces is already working much more with behavior.
So I, as a gestalter, much more often shape the behavior than the appearance.
This is also a paradigm shift.
I suddenly think that it looks more and more irrelevant for success, just the usability becomes an application.
And if I then go a step further into these natural user interfaces, where I can control things by voice, by speech, by touch, by gesture and not by mouse and cursor, then I am even faster and even more immediate.
But this also leads me back to the point, when do these things become more intuitive?
when they become more intuitive and then I have to strapazieren and look at my little friend here again, what does this mean just from the standpoint of cognitive ergonomy, when is something really intuitive now?
And that is always something intuitive for us humans, when I have to think about it as little as possible.
So apparently, he doesn’t want to think, but rather to make it relatively simple.
The less I think about it, the more intuitive it is.
What does this mean for the designer?
That is, if we look at how we can transfer existing models of behavior from one thing to another, for example the metaphors, then I can use it as a gestalter.
That is to say, I can just transfer such an intuitive, human model of behavior to a software and thus make the software much more user-friendly.
Of course, the question arises, what is actually the most intuitive scheme of action of us humans and now I’ve already betrayed it.
This is the so-called osit model.
Used by each of us and osit is an acronym and stands for orienting, selecting, informing, transacting.
Each of them does this all the time, but is powerlessly unconscious and almost intuitive or even instinctive.
The model is already expressed in the womb and is intercultural, so it works worldwide in jung and alt, and is used by us all the time, without most people knowing that this model exists.
The seed itself is approximately fifty to seventy thousand times of us depending on activity, so in sleep it has been found that it is then less frequently strapazed than am tag.
I can now direct, select, inform, transact and transfer this mental model of behavior to an interaction system.
And through this kind of transmission, similar to the metaphor of the desktop, it is no longer a metaphor of a physical object, but a metaphor of a pattern of action, a principle of action.
This is on a higher level of ease of use than the transmission of a classic metaphor, namely the desktop.
and if I transfer this now, for example, in which I orient as an overview express, select as a selection, inform in the case, it comes great to me, I can &apos;s myself in detail, and yes, transagieren means, I can also throw it somewhere or send it to someone or shop and so on,
Then I can transmit it all.
I will try this badly by an example.
Everybody has already eaten cake.
Overview: now I interact sozusagen with the object, can again zoom, reinzoomen.
I get the whole overview, can now filter on this and can say, say just me all the sache with chocolate, for example.
And I suddenly have an interface, which is much more intuitive and much more natural.
Because that I can grasp things like the pieces, touch them, and they come to me, is much more natural than if I could make these things accessible through hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms, so to speak.
Imagination is more important than knowledge, and with this sentence I would also like to conclude, and again point out, that even designers must think differently in order to come up with new solutions, and in this sense I thank you very much for your attention and please.
I would like to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity.
The first thing when you grow up as a child, as a baby, is that you are bothered with what discharges you have, yes? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the bag and move, the more, so to speak, your curiosity is naturally aroused by it.
Curiosity cannot be learned.
Therefore, all who are here and are curious are, in fact, people who have a trait that cannot be learned.
I am going to do it now, practically this whole environmental debate, the end of the world, forty years of club-of-rome, in quality to implement.
And there is a central point here.
And it hangs on phosphorus.
Give Pee a chance.
for each tag enter + give size order about two grams of phosphorus ab and for each tag you must include two grams of phosphorus.
Otherwise, you can’t have teeth.
They can’t store energy.
You can’t have bones.
We could only slip through the world seas as amorphous molluscs.
In fact, we do not absorb and release phosphorus.
Surprisingly, it is that we are dealing with something here and there, which in fact would not be a matter of course, but it is not.
Everyone talks about energy, but no one talks about the phosphorus problem.
The phosphorus problem is much more critical.
We hang from two countries ab.
We have only had phosphorus for two years and already now, the phosphorus mining is bringing much more uranium into the environment worldwide than is used in all nuclear plants.
In the last twenty years alone, fifteen thousand tons of uranium have been distributed on our fields in Germany.
And we take it all up.
It causes leukemia in the childhood.
And we think we would protect the environment if we were a little less harmful.
So, for example, protect the environment, save less cars.
Protect the environment, make less garbage.
Protect the environment and consume less energy.
But that is not a protection.
This is as if I said, protect your child, hit it only three times instead of five.
That’s just a bit less destruction.
If we think so from der Wiege bis zur Bahre, then our whole land will sooner or later become a cemetery.
That’s why I think from the ward to the ward.
And the most important thing here is to look at the ground, as the first.
Over sixty percent of carbon is stored in the soil.
At the moment, we build corn and lose between eleven and thirty kilograms of thirty tons per hectare, or on the square meter, too.
That is, we lose in the soil about five thousand times more than it is newly formed.
Of course, we can first tackle the rubbish problem.
And everything is either packaging or content.
For example, at house waste, twenty percent of the waste in the middle of the wind.
And as we get older, the winds get bigger.
They are all in the forwindel phase.
And yes?
A baby needs about six thousand windels.
We could, of course, reduce that by ten percent, but what does that mean?
In China, this is balanced in one second.
This is completely uninteresting.
So the question is, how do we deal with this windeln?
This is one of the proofs that men are not pigs.
I will tell you.
Because the phosphorus is discharged from the pigs through the feasts.
with the man over the urine.
Yes yes.
Thus, men cannot be pigs.
Because that’s proven and proven, isn’t it?
Traditionally, we think in the environmental debate, we are too many in the world.
And if you tell the people that if you deny the people that they exist, if you say that would be better, you<unk>’t be there at all, then they become greedy and hostile.
And so someone like Al Gore, one of our great heroes, says, there is nothing more important than stabilizing the human population.
In Israel it is said that if you correct a human life, you correct the earth.
Here it is said, the more you embrace, the better.
Yes yes.
The first question is, are we really too many?
If you look at the ants, the weight of the ants on earth, then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans.
I could also eat termites, but in the U.S. no one likes termites, in so far, even though they are vegetarians.
That is to say, the ants weigh much more than us.
And because they work physically much harder than we do, and because they only live for three to six months, they correspond in their weight, in energy consumption, to some thirty billion people.
That is to say, we are not too many, we are too stupid, right?
And where you see how far we are away from what we really wanted and could<unk>, and how sad we are that we are at all on earth, you can see that, for example, offenbach has a program, until twenty-four, you want to be climate neutral here, right?
They can only be climate-neutral if they do not exist, right?
The only chance.
Have you ever seen a climate-neutral tree?
And yes?
One only one?
That is, all our intelligence means that we want to be dumb as trees, right?
And yes?
No baum is carbon neutral.
Fortunately not, right?
There is no problem of overpopulation on trees.
There are still 600 billion trees in the Amazon alone.
Have you ever heard of the overpopulation problem of trees?
That is, all our intelligence means that we want to be dumb as trees.
And where they see, even with something like Demeter, the strictest bio-and agriculture, does not allow our own metabolic products to decline.
Every year we lose as much as three million tons of phosphorus, which would really have to go back into the circles.
And so we are too many.
Alone about it.
This means that we feel so guilty on earth that we say there is no bio-agriculture, no bioland, no nature-et-progrès, and as they all call it, that allows our own excreta to go back.
Isn’t that sad?
Therefore, we are too many.
It<unk> makes sense to be less harmful when it comes to oil use.
But where are we useful?
We try to minimize our ecological footprint, but it’s about having a big footprint that’s useful.
We want to be good for society, we want to be good for the economy, but when it comes to the environment, the highest thing is not being there, right?
Zero emissions, yes?
They can only have zero emissions when they are not there.
Even if they were to shoot themselves now, they would have emissions.
So you can’t solve it.
We can do it differently.
We can recover our nutrients.
We do agriculture in Brazil in the area where we recover the nutrients.
In this way, we can get back nutrients from agriculture.
We do this in China, for example, where we directly take the waste out of it.
In China, a one night's dish is still called honey, sozusagen, right?
And in our Western world, we have always been too stupid to bring back our nutrients.
That is to say, the entire history of Western civilization is characterized by the fact that the city has always only taken men, but the Bauern has never returned anything.
As a result, the cities had to grow more and more, because the builders went into those cities and the cities had to pick up their nutrients more and more away.
Therefore, all Western empires are always expanding until they have no longer managed the infrastructure and then they are imploded.
And yes?
In China, the war is different.
Man has managed a bruchlos civilization for over five thousand years, because one was always in the position to bring back nutrients.
Even today, when you are invited to eat in China, after the meal, you are expected to stay until you go to the toilet.
Because it is unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you.
When you have them with you, you have invited them to eat, not to be a nutritious thief.
That is, you can see on the internet how to recover those nutrients.
The really beautiful thing about this is that if you do the tut, that is to say, agriculture, produce biogas, on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in favelas, then a farmer can thus make about a thousand and fifty hundred dollars and maintain the plant with it, raise chickens and pigs, and either and vegetables and fish.
And the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the favelas is declining by over ninety percent.
Therefore, we do not have to control the people to be as bad as possible.
We can support you to be good.
This is, of course, high-tech agriculture, but the plants carry on themselves.
The by-product is clean water.
And they are designed in such a way, by the design, that a bauer can easily accommodate them.
This means that the crime rates are going back.
And none of these plants, we have now built over a hundred and fifty in the last twenty years, none of these plants have ever been sabotaged.
They could so easily simply re-throw a liter of oil and then the plant would be ruined over the years.
It does not find place.
That is to say, we don’t have to control the people to be as bad as possible.
We can support you to be good.
In other words, we need to recover the phosphorus.
And by the way, if you want to do something out of it, write down, in Germany the most suitable of all clearances is that in Frankfurt.
Unfortunately not in Offenbach, but maybe you can help the Frankfurter and a bit of it.
because the Frankfurt plant could best recover the phosphorus.
And it has to come back.
We can see that phosphorus is really critical.
And we see that it really succeeds.
We have been in the Netherlands for over three years now.
The Dutch government has declared that it will be the first country in the world to recover phosphorus.
But we need the whole thing.
Understand, there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus produced worldwide.
The OPEC is a bunch of babysitters.
Twenty-six countries control forty percent of the oil reserves.
And the oil we will be able to replace with other energy carriers.
But the phosphorus will not be replaced.
Therefore, it is not about making the existing a little less bad, it is about doing something right.
And most importantly, the first question is what is right.
In other words, it is about efficiency, not efficiency.
In the Netherlands, this is easier to understand, of course, because in the Netherlands the land is built on flowers.
And yes?
Imagine, for example, when your wife is sad, when you get upset, and you come with fifty roses.
Completely inefficient.
But very effective, right?
Or take a lipstick.
A woman in Germany eats about six to three kilograms during her lifetime.
With it.
This is not scientifically correct, because we don’t know how much kissing is being given.
But a lipstick, even in this lighting, I can tell you, is completely inefficient, but quite effective, right?
Everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient.
It’s not about resource efficiency, but efficiency.
The question is, what is right?
Not to burn the clarified sludge even a little better and thus abzulagern it and lose all the materials for circuits in the combustion plant, but first to ask, how do you close circuits?
Imagine Mozart efficiently.
And yes?
When I invite you to dinner and say, yes, there is a tablet with the offenbach flavor and a glass of washer to it.
Wonderful, &apos; no?
That is efficient.
Everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient.
When you fall in love with someone, efficiently?
And yes?
That is, everything that matters in life is not about saving, avoiding, reducing.
The entire environmental debate.
We say to the people, oh yeah, you have no environmental awareness in the south.
No, throwing away is exactly the right thing, right?
In every star, where one wipes away, out, yes, one creates life opportunities again.
But the false things.
When you throw away the false things, you have a rubbish problem.
This is how we think of the north.
There, every footprint is nightly.
When they run, yes, they destroy every footprint on the ground.
Because the mouse will die from the ground, and the wind and the water will wash the ground away.
But if they are in Italy, every footprint means that the wasser stays in the wheat for longer.
So, it’s about creating a large footprint that becomes a moist area.
Not debt management.
We say sustainability in Germany.
And yes?
But if I ask you, how are you doing so with your wife?
What do you say then?
It is sustainable.
Then I say, sweet greetings, right?
That is the minimum.
So don’t save, give up, avoid.
Every waste is a nutrient.
And it is a delight when you see in Italy how the people in the high arches so &apos;ne coladose out of the car, to this.
Because you know, this is a lustvoller move.
It’s not a form of revier behavior, right?
You can show me, I was there.
But with the right design, please.
For example, we have developed an ice cream packaging, which is at room temperature and is not fluid.
You can throw them wherever you go and stand.
Within two hours, she’d run out everywhere.
And it contains rare plants together, so by throwing them away they contribute to the biodiversity.
In other words, we are useful, not less harmful.
There are also two circles.
Not everything is supposed to be compostable.
a TV or a washing machine, which they only use, they do not consume them.
Only those things that wear off, such as shoes, such as brake pads, such as car tires, must be such that they go into biological systems.
The things that are only used go into technical systems.
But today we are only talking about biological systems.
And yes?
As for the sneaker, right?
very direct advertising, and not for the company puma per se, but for the fact that you now help this company to make these products successful.
Because not we do not make these things free of them.
And yes?
Therefore, if I invite them to eat and say, “This is free of chicken,” it will not help them at all.
No, we’re celebrating what drin is.
Positive positive.
Not like a detox.
Not poisonous inside.
But everything that is drin is useful.
these are the first shoes with which you can put the cavalry start on the footgangerampel and where rubber can go in biological cycles, right?
All of this is composteable from it.
And if we succeed, we succeed, of course, for adidas, for nike, for her and Mauritz and the entire textile industry.
And that’s half of all drainage problems worldwide caused by the textile industry.
So help me, ask the people a little.
Puma, do you really take it seriously?
Because they have already changed the chairman twice.
And I'm not so sure if they're really dabeable.
So, help me a little about it.
But it goes.
Yes yes.
This is what is just being presented.
That goes.
We can do things now so that when they wear off, when they break down, they can go into biological cycles.
Technical circuits exist &apos;s the same .
There is a direct backnames system for it.
This is the first eco-friendly backpack, actually, designed to go back into the cycle.
Also, so in any store you can get those things back.
If you come up with that, right?
Do you remember the wind?
At the moment it is rubbish.
Those windeln rum are everywhere, nahezu.
In the country where people come to money.
There’s a vorn on the landfill, but also elsewhere in the countryside, right?
If we change the plastic so that it can go into biological systems, if we change the water reservoirs, insinuate that they can just return to cellulose-based, then you can plant a hundred and fifty trees with a baby in Israel or in Tunisia.
And yes?
Only if they take these wheels, they crush, sterilize and take the powder to plant trees with it.
Thus, the baby is carbon-positive for the whole life, from the very beginning.
So, we don’t need to be climate neutral, we can be climate positive.
In other words, it is about a beneficial poop print.
Yes, by the way.
And yes?
We can do that.
We can re-invent everything.
I have established an institute for this.
In the meantime, there are a lot of people working there and you can all engage.
There is an extra association, cradle-to-cradle-verein, where everyone can participate.
So no longer save, versions, avoid, reduce, no longer debt management, but intelligent waste.
Does it make you curious?
Thank you very much.
The work of the interpreter.
Music as a language.
In the description of my speech it is written that I, as an interpreter, understand myself as a translator, also in the English word.
Performers are translators of written notes in sounding music.
That as a translator you must not only translate word for word the text into another language, but also understand the deeper meaning of the words and word context in order to produce a meaningful translation, everyone who has to do with foreign languages knows.
Translating from German into English can require more knowledge, especially when it comes to dichtung or even poetry.
It is very strange, however, for the whole world, what we musicians do with our music language.
As an interpreter of a piece of music, I only have the written notes at first.
They are sure that the composer in those notes has written exactly everything that he has thought of.
In reality, those notes are very vague and inaccurate.
These notes are approximately as accurate or inaccurate as a verbal, although very apparently penibelst accurate, description of a landscape.
For in this verbal landscape description, the smell of the flowers is not to smell, the degree of greenery is only to perceive, the sound of the winds is not to hear, not to feel.
That is to say, the interpreter must translate this inaccurate information of the note language into another, namely, audible, concrete, non-verbal music language.
Today I want to translate to you what I otherwise musically translate, then interpret, again into a verbal language.
practically a translation of the translation.
Therefore, I prefer to do the whole thing in German, because if I had to translate it again into English, it would be equivalent to the translation of the translation.
So, the music also works for me as much as the spoken language.
The notes recorded have the function of the letter of a script.
Therefore, it is not enough to just learn to read notes and press the corresponding keys on the piano or the correct star on a violin page.
In fact, it would only be the letters that one has learned to paint.
The meaning of the letter can only be recognized when you know the language.
Consequently, it takes at least as long for the learning process of the music language as it takes for the spoken language.
Since there are also abstufungen, whether one learns it for household use, only passively understood, or one can also actively speak, up to the musical mother tongue.
The work of an interpreter begins similarly to that of a theater director.
After first choosing to play a piece because you are enthusiastic about it, you first look at the background of the composition.
Information about the piece is collected in secondary literature.
You read in the briefen, tagebüchern, note, or if it is a word, the thought of the composer himself exists.
One studies the works that he composed before and after.
You make a comparison.
The motives to write it.
How and what did he feel?
What were his circumstances of life, such as those of society and politics?
All of this interests me.
One thinks in this time, by, for example, looking at contemporary images or reading literature.
Over time, however, you as an interpreter already have a wealth of knowledge about the composer you play often, and it becomes easier and easier for you to think and feel in him.
The composer becomes more and more a friend with whom one lives together.
His desire to write the piece is becoming more and more my personal desire to play it.
Now that the notes are nothing more than an accurate record of the composer’s endeavors, but only a restraint, I now apply this restraint to fill it again with meaning and meaning.
I will then say with my own words what could have been written between these twists.
I play explaining what these tones could mean.
Now for me and for the composer then and what they could mean for him today.
Every tone, every phrase gets a meaning, because I feel it myself, because it springs from my now personally lived.
It must be consistent for me here and now, otherwise I cannot convince my audience that this is my intention.
It’s always a very happy concert if I get to have the experience, the piece that I’ve worked out so long in advance, how new to experience.
Just as you experience a happy new day again and again, even with the same rituals of life, getting up, breakfast, to work, so I also experience the same piece again and again.
I have grown a day older again, the seasons change, my pulse goes slower in the evening than in the morning, in a concert hall it takes longer for the sound to come back home.
I take the breath of the audience true, consciously or unconsciously.
All that affects me and all that affects my experience with the composition as well.
It is also very wonderful when I stand on stage with a duo partner and we have the same wavelength.
Then the same thing happens as in a good, engaged conversation.
One brings a new idea into it and immediately it is answered with a reaction.
It’s exciting, because then things happen that we haven’t tried and that you can’t try anyway.
It is great fun to make music in this way, and you as the audience have then experienced how the music communicates live.
Every concert is a different concert.
I will never play like I do now again.
I can’t play today as I did in twenty years.
Then I will have more life experience than I do today and therefore I will have much more colour, emotions and sensations on my palette of music sounds than I do today.
Sure, I will then have some colour blades thrown out too, but for that I will get new ones.
I have a net concrete example of this.
It was on a piano course for music students with my beloved old teacher, Professor Jürgen ude, a well-known Beethoven specialist, concert pianist and longtime professor of the music university here in Stuttgart.
Unfortunately, I was still too young, so I was already retired when I finally started studying.
But I was very fortunate to have him very early, at thirteen, to learn and so I was already on his courses at my school time.
I was seventeen when I once again attended one of his courses and played the last of Chopin's four ballads, a retrospective.
He asked me what the introduction of this ballad was for me.
This is such a treadmill part.
And in my youth I said, expectation.
That’s what Schmunzelte meant, right?
That must be the age difference.
For me, it means remembrance.
He was over sixty.
Well, with siebzehn you still have dreams, but no significant memories.
I play the play again every couple of years today and it has always changed for me, although not a single note has changed.
Every time it’s exciting, because I’m always reading something new out.
An example of this from a completely different reich. monet has the seerosen x-mal gemalt.
It is always the same garden, but at different times of day, with different light.
He has translated the sereros in various ways, as he saw them, as they acted on him at this moment.
his personal impressions of the seerosen.
The x-maligne interpretation of a piece is comparable to this.
In the meantime, I am also older than Chopin at thirty-two years old, as is the piece written.
He only lived for thirty-nine years.
And it’s important for me to look at those notes over and over again, even if I mean to be able to see them outwardly.
To keep the dialect, directly with the composer.
Because the notes are the only direct connection to him.
Especially if he is already dead.
How do you start speaking the language of music?
As I said, it takes approximately as long as the spoken language.
Often there is music lessons and so that you only learn to read the notes.
One practically learns to read it first before speaking just one word.
You learn to find the tones to the notes on the instrument.
If then all the fingers move in a timely and correct manner as it is stated in the notes, then the tones come out, which together sound like music.
If this is done without errors, the student gets the next hardest piece.
Interpretation is hardly talked about in beginner classes.
Well, then it’s ahead soon, that’s a quick piece.
Slowly slowly.
signals, f and b, and so on.
Most people here know that.
But even if these data are implemented, it still remains a mere technical matter.
And it’s still not an interpretation.
I am amazed.
I am surprised that one often forgets something very elementary.
Namely, in order to make music on the instrument, your own musical tone and feel should be already present.
In other words, singing.
A child who hasn’t learned to sing because his parents haven’t suggested it, will not do it on his own.
It’s like speaking.
It is necessary to have his own experiences and ideas of music, in order to then bring it to sound through another possibility, also through an instrument.
People who have never sung have never immediately felt with their own body what it is like to form a tone.
Create a phrase with your own breath.
The musical instrument is the extension of our body.
Our voices are for singing, our hands and feet for dancing.
So the hammerheads in the piano are the continuation of my finger.
The melody arises from the singing and the rhythm from the dance.
The long-lasting berieselung today with music is therefore not beneficial.
You no longer need to make music yourself when it becomes boring.
You no longer need to sing or sing a song.
Every one’s own music is plattgemacht when you are forever sounded out with music.
Certainly, there are some of them who say, yes, but what do you do if I can’t sing?
I ask, can’t you sing, because you think you can’t sing?
Or B, because you didn’t learn to sing?
For both, it is not too late to start to find out if they can’t, or to learn how to properly use these small muscles that set up the voicebands.
This can be trained.
or c, because it has been testified to them that they are incompetent.
I ask, how competent was this diagnosis?
Have you ever picked up a second- or drittmeinung, as it is said today?
Or, they don’t like music and therefore don’t want to have anything to do with it.
But then I would be sad, because music is a beautiful, communicative sache.
But maybe you can even override them.
Yes, so you see, in any case, no one has to be a hopeless candidate.
But please don’t tell me, I don’t understand classical music.
I cannot tell if it is good or bad.
I answer, but you can say for sure whether you like it or not.
For I don’t believe, someone says, I don’t know, if I taste it, because I can’t love.
So, they give up and don’t eat just because they can’t cook.
So you don’t have to go to classical music versions, because they don’t play an instrument.
Listen to them consciously and tell them whether they like it or not.
Whether the music is too sweet or too sweet to you.
Say what you feel.
Over time, they also get claims and want a little more spice as drinks or tastes even fine differences out.
Why do I demand now from my audience that it also actively listen?
Because music is a language and a language to communicate there.
A work of art that you do not look at has no power to work.
The food that has been lovingly cooked by a chef or a chef must be eaten and not just watched or exchanged recipes.
So please listen when a music is being played.
It’s not just a noisy bullshit.
If a child grows up in an environment where the adults play active music or at least listen to active music, then it is quite easy for a music teacher to ask what color is your flower?
Can you play them in blue for me now?
And the child plays, after a memorial break, instead of a red before, now a blue flower.
And this sounds very different than before.
This was then the very beginning of a personal musical expression.
This is the first step towards an interpretation.
And what happens if you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred, two hundred, or even three hundred years ago?
In the meantime, these instruments have evolved.
There was at the time Bachs as an instrument, not even a piano.
It was simply not yet invented.
I think der Bach would have been thrilled if he had had the vocal capabilities of today’s modern piano.
Today I can bring the sound concepts that the Bach has had to sound on the modern flügel, which a Baroque cembalo can’t.
Also from Beethoven it is known that he had heard more than he had already become deaf.
Today, a modern orchestra is in a position to play everything that an orchestra has rejected as unplayable.
Therefore, the composers are dependent on us interpreters, who reinvent the pieces.
so that they can hear what they have only conceived in the mind.
And also what they would think in their minds today.
Or what I imagined today, because of what they might have imagined.
Thank you very much.
Do you know what they are?
Have you ever been jealous?
And how did it feel?
disgraceful .
I have a friend who drives a passenger.
When I then come, with my little v w piesel and put myself down, this feeling comes up.
I am shooting something through the head.
I say, ulf, why do you need such a big car?
It loses half of its value in the first year.
And in general, you work and much less than I do.
Why do I have to afford such a small car?
And then I immediately realize, that’s unfair.
It is against justice.
And as I say the word justice, this unpleasant feeling is gone.
Our body has invented a great method to make unpleasant feelings like them simply disappear.
You can also try it out with words like rache or profit or similar.
With this mechanism, I would like to explain something to you today, or bring something closer, which you unconsciously probably are familiar with.
The mechanism is derived from the lie.
But don’t think of the lie, as you may have heard it, when people say that no one intends to build a wall.
And then the stones turn up, so that the sight is blocked from them.
In such a lie, they see that the liar himself does not believe what is said.
Furthermore, it is easy to verify that he has something quite different in mind.
He is deceiving only you and not himself.
No, the lie I’m talking about has to do with deceiving themselves.
They need this lie, a lifelong lying, in order to maintain a self-deception.
They can be less easily, yes, checked out or even crashed.
You need time.
There is an anecdote about that time, which you may know.
The Spanish painter Pablo Picasso once portrayed a woman.
This woman subsequently complained that the portrait would not look like her.
Picasso answered, just wait.
It is becoming more and more similar to them.
When you laugh, you realize how important this lie is and how much time it takes to learn something that artists can very well communicate to us.
Artists have a disturbed relationship with lies.
The artist shares something with them, and especially this lady, that she doesn’t see when she just looks in the mirror.
The artist shares with them in such a portrait something myth, which they only get acquainted with when they look at this work of art over and over again.
Then this unpleasant feeling disappears, it might not even look like them and it will become more and more like them.
Here they have this mechanism, with which we can use the lie as a great invention for stabilizing our relationships.
And not only in art, but also in folk tales, in mythology, in stories, it reappears.
You may know the idea of the lady, who looked in the mirror one morning and asked him, who is the most beautiful in the whole country?
One day, this mirror says, yes, there is a more beautiful one.
behind the seven mountains and so on.
And they also know how much hostility comes from this true outcome, even the mirror cannot lie, from this true outcome.
But we should simply familiarize ourselves with the fact that one cannot tell a woman that there is a more beautiful one elsewhere.
Here it is necessary to repeat what we understand by politically correctness.
We need at this point this lie, which sustains us in the deception, without which we cannot live.
We have such great lies not only in the art, in the folklore, but also in science.
And there is this story of the wife of the bishops of Worchester.
She heard of this book by Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species and the Abstamming of Man.
that man should descend from the Affe and, yes, there is at least a common ancestor between man and the Affe.
And then she ran, ran to her husband and said, "That's probably not true," what Charles is writing.
The human being is supposed to descend from the ancestor or have a common ancestor.
No, no, this is not possible.
And if it is true, then we must prevent people from getting knowledge of it.
Why do we have to prevent human knowledge of something if it is true?
Because we cannot live without these life lies.
because we have this self-deception, this feeling of being great, abstammung from the highest being, not from such a nature, from such something unpredictable as an organism that still exists, to a stone comparable and other things, that is unsustainable for us.
So, we can’t even endure these things.
We must prevent people from gaining knowledge of things, especially if they are true.
So that you can see how slowly this mechanism dissolves and what the traces it leaves, leading to something other than this great image of ourselves, look like, I will bring you another story.
A very nice story, as I mean.
My wife told me.
She came one day from school, she is a teacher, and she told about a student.
A student with autism.
She especially likes him because he has a tendency to be sincere.
And she asked him, what are your hobbies?
And then he said, yes, I am at the fire department.
And because I’m in the fire department, I’m interested in pyrotechnics.
Yes, you already feel it when you are heater at this star. there is something wrong.
I told my wife that whenever a man uses the word because in a moral justification, we should try to replace it with the word though.
Do this once and then you will learn the sentence.
Although I am in the fire department, I am interested in pyrotechnics.
They feel, that’s the real truth behind the outcome.
such a small bub, who is not interested in fires.
He is interested in fireworks.
But there are no associations that we can look around, where one learns how to make a fire.
There is only the second best, the firearm.
He has signed up.
And besides, one doesn’t even tell his teacher that one would like to put a fire somewhere and rejoice when the fire then lays up.
No, it just looks much better when we show that we are competent to eliminate the dangers that others only create when they just set fire.
Here you have this small mechanism.
This is a reference to the fact that in the depths of the bub already knew that he is actually related to the fire, but that he can’t say that out loud.
Here you have this sensor between the unconscious and the conscious, which immediately responds without you being able to do anything about it, and the things you know they look very different, so that they can sound much better for themselves and others.
Thus, such words simply arise, which we also repeatedly use in the language of politically correct speech.
In fact, we know that something else is the case.
But we know, when we say this, the social relationships are very sensitively disturbed.
We can’t just do that.
It is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function.
I would like to tell you what we found out at my institute.
According to what logic this deception, this self-deception, the already-being, a reality other than that of which we already know unconsciously that it is valid to spread outwardly.
Here I will present you two, maybe even three examples.
The first example assumes what many of you know and some of you appreciate, but very few do not need at all.
I mean the soul.
What is that soul?
The soul is so spiritual, says Leibniz, for example.
It is something that is not of a more material, material nature.
And if you have people in front of you who are firmly convinced that they have a soul, or you can also say, who believe that they have been raised to life by the soul, then they imagine this as if the soul were such a spiritual frame over them, not of matter, they themselves are only of flesh and blood, something stone-like, bonded to the earth, transient, perishable, irrelevant, and all.
And of this soul they now think that they are somehow present in this cloudy nature, in this airy nature, anima is called it in Latin, der lufthauch.
And when this height of air then rises over man, then he is filled with spirit, with spirit, with nature, which can only live, and precisely with soul.
And then he can run away.
This is the idea of how the soul works.
It must therefore be added to man from the outside.
We should also perceive it as something that must be indispensable to our lives.
And if they have this prerequisite in mind, then they understand the logic with which we experience this happiness of being able to improve our world through a lie.
Because now you can use a dreasatz.
Dreisatz is still known from school.
This is now a thesis here, which describes us a logic.
This, by the way, is the most difficult part of my talk.
Here you need some logic, but also the willingness to lie.
In other words, to lie so much that they can simply misuse this logic.
In this phrase, there are three sentences.
The first sentence is, Klaus claims, there is no soul.
The second sentence is, if Klaus is right, then he has no soul.
Now there is a dirty phrase.
I have especially highlighted him here.
This is a dirty phrase that immediately appears in people who have a strong sense for a soul.
They say, whoever has no soul is dead and can claim nothing at all.
And here they feel &apos;s already.
This logic comes here in this, yes, in this deceitful speech.
You see it immediately.
The first two sentences are logically correct.
I can claim everything.
The logic does not make a statement about reality.
I can say that the Chancellor is a man.
And if I’m right, then the Chancellor is a man.
If I’m not right, then the Chancellor is not a man.
The logic does not make a statement of what is true.
I can claim everything.
But the important thing is, if I’m right, then it’s true.
So when Klaus says, there is no soul.
Secondly, if he is right, then he has no soul.
These things are logically correct.
And now our deceiving consciousness is immediately felt, something can be done about it.
There is a third sentence, which has nothing to do with the first two sentences, and it is as if the opposite of the first sentence has already been proven and assumed.
In fact, we have to prove whether the soul exists or not.
But with this logic, which simply makes use of two phrases that are logically correct, and hanging one that looks like it has something to do with it, so we can save our life lies.
So, we act as if it is actually impossible to live without a soul.
And we are very happy about that.
We can continue these things in different examples.
At present, we have a very modern example, which repeatedly fills the daily newspapers.
Here you have to keep another philosophical theme, a permanent brenner from philosophy, present.
This has to do with going back to the fourteenth century.
There was a scholar named johannes buridanus, after whom the buridanese donkey is named.
The Buridan ass is a donkey that consists of a purer nature.
He does not have that soul.
That is such a natural thing.
And if they place it exactly in the middle of two equal-size hills, it will starve.
For he does not know which hill he should go to first.
Therefore, it is not exactly in there.
This is how nature is presented.
Forces of equal size with opposing signs resolve each other.
Nothing happens at all.
Only if they then give another example, so if it immediately makes one of the hoops bigger, then there is no need for reason and nothing at all.
It automatically runs to the right thought.
If you have this idea that you are also in nature somehow driven, determined, by the larger heaps that immediately attract you, then you also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will.
And if we are already here in Frankfurt am Main, I would like to remind you of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research.
Since there is a scholar called a wolf singer, and it is sometimes said of him, a wolf singer claims, there is no freedom of will.
Now we can again form the second sentence and can say, if the wolf singer is right, then there is no freedom of will.
These statements are absolutely logical and correct.
And what we can now read almost daily in the daily newspaper, you can find in this dirty sentence.
For example, anyone who does not have free will cannot be held accountable for his actions and behaviors and is therefore unaccountable.
You also have it here again.
In fact, one must first prove whether there is such a thing as freedom of will.
But the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first sentence was false from the outset, as if, of course, the opposite had to be assumed without evidence.
And now you can simply, if you want to do something yourself, if you want to test something yourself, and especially if you want to make people happy, practice this courage to lie.
Practice this, for example, when you encounter a human being to whom you can then say that there is no predictor.
And please do not use the German word for predictor, which means prophet.
You shouldn’t say that, it would be a bit politically incorrect.
You say, there is no predictor.
They will immediately learn of one for whom there is of course such a predictor, which you cannot prove.
And you already have a problem.
For while they are busy clarifying that they cannot prove that there is no predictor, the man is quite happy.
Er is very happy about it, because is she has getäuscht.
because he has led them on a journey where he himself does not even stop.
In fact, this man is not interested in evidence.
He is only interested in keeping himself free from necessity, in having to prove that there is a predictor.
Thus, in the art of shifting the burden of proof, they experience the greatness of the lie.
And if you once again have the opportunity to feel this treasury in other people, do it, because you will make others happy if you don’t remind them of their self-falsehood in this way.
Thank you for your attention.
Yes, good day.
I asked Lilly if I could mention her.
She is one of the organizers here of this great event and asked me if I would like to give a lecture here and spread my idea.
I must honestly say, you did it, it was difficult for me at first to talk about my idea.
And maybe I can introduce my insel project that I will try to introduce to you.
But, of course, it is the sum of quite, quite a lot of ideas.
I belong probably, are the two net girls still there, I belong probably to the generation that has provided for this bad eco image, because I nine hundred and nine years ago already started to study machinenbau in Karlsruhe, a technical university, today it is called, I believe, kit.
And I was not in the eighties after Berlin, because I wanted to make renewable energy and that didn’t happen in Karlsruhe.
from the Leopoldshafen nuclear research facility.
All of them were called KFA, even the Jülich hieß KFA.
Today they are called project carriers.
Because a good engineer has either great cars built or nuclear power plants.
But such deafs as a solar pedal, out of which somehow a hundred watts come out of the square meter, that was a toy.
And in Berlin there was a crazy engineering collective.
I am grateful to the premium-cola-man that the word has been re-rehabilitated once again, because after the mauerfall one could not use the word anymore, because everything was left and bad.
However, this was not the case in the 1980s.
It was then that there were self-governed alternative companies and one of them was in Kreuzberg im mehringhof, where the evil was assumed.
The place of terrorism, but it was called wuseltronik and it made wind and solar energy and I didn’t start in the eighties.
And yes, much of what has been said today affects me very much, because there were many, many beautiful expressions that I also experienced.
I worked for eleven years in the collective, which was basic democratic.
We were twenty people.
I have been ten years long I have hardly doubted whether my tolles engineerstudium may really be an an schwachsinnige sache diswende, because also all my father’s colleagues have always suggested to him, you have the money to the window thrown out at your child.
He’s dealing with shadows.
And it was really very, very bitter, and then you get into such a phase, just popping up that one picture on holding, where I asked myself after ten years, a thousand d-mark were that and then still, basic wage, unit wage in the collective of course, if that really should be so great.
And then I ended up until the nineteenth and then together with friends I became co-founder of the company Solon, which then, along with the spin-off q-cells, became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world.
This is a huge success story, but even then, of course, we have the problem of a growing company again, and then we have two thousand and six, a small group, decided that we should start small again and go back and dedicate ourselves to the next theme of the future and that is, my memory and our memory, it’s crazy again, that starts again with people saying, what should der quatsch, that’s not all, we’re talking about storage.
And then I brought you a project, which I want to introduce to you now.
And the title of the lecture was, and how to get 100% renewable.
And we just started with a relatively simple, crazy story, asking where one could use a memory meaningfully today.
On this island, this is the graceful island on the Azores.
Yes, that’s the data.
There are four and a half thousand people.
They now have a renewable energy share of 15 percent.
And the question is, why don’t they have it anymore?
This is simply not technologically possible.
When more wind power comes together, the system starts to fail.
This is what I always tell the politician when they visit our facility in Berlin-Adlershof.
They always say, why?
We already have twenty percent in Germany.
It may not be a problem.
We have seven percent in Europe and our network is physically the European one.
If we had twenty percent in Europe, then we would already have the same problems that the people on this island have.
The question was simple, calculate the war of two thousand in 2006, the first contacts with the island have begun, just count through.
How big would such a battery actually have to be in order to bring such an island to twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, maybe even seventy percent renewable?
And yes, I’ll go a slide further.
The conventional system looks like this everywhere in the world.
By the way, about 100 gigawatts of diesel-based electric power are generated per year in the world.
This is equivalent to the power of a hundred nuclear power plants, because it goes<unk> fast everywhere.
The energy hunger of the world, which is taking place, is wiped out with diesel, because there is no need for permission.
It goes fast.
Man puts so &apos;ne ciste hin.
And then it usually looks like that.
There are always three diesels running in it, two are always waiting.
Well, one sees that below is just the last one.
We also obtained very accurate data.
And the wind power plant or the solar system, or whatever it is, is usually a backup system or a system, which can only feed in small amounts here.
It was easy for our soul to say, okay,
The diesel will back up and the wind, the sun will control the last so that you can capture the larger proportion.
And if you want to go over twenty, thirty percent of renewable energy, so energy per year, not the power in the moment, then you have to turn off the diesel.
That is to say, at that moment they must ensure that the renewable energies can take over the entire network.
Of course, they can only do so if they are managed in some way here.
No one in the world has done this before.
This is in a small style, so you can also operate your shaver in the car via a small switcher.
People are always asking me, what are you doing at the Adlershof?
It is already going.
But if they want to combine several of these switchers and they want to build a network, then it becomes extremely complicated.
And our soul was just, we wanted to come to seventy to ninety percent renewable and then there is still that rest, the last rest, the last ten, twenty percent renewable mit, that will be very, very expensive and that will also not work that you make this from batteries.
that will definitely be an energy carrier, which then, hydrogen, methane, power to gas know you or sch, that will then be.
They then need to go to a seasonal store and balance winter-summer rather than just day-night.
We just wanted to know what a normal, stinknormalen electrochemical battery is.
How far can you get from that at all?
And then they employed a whole host of simulations.
and have simulated wind and sun and the load and came to the very exciting result that compared to the conventional system, which after twenty years requires an average electricity price of about fifty cents per kilowatt-hour, about forty-four cents comes out.
These were the very first calculations six years ago.
And then we said, OK,
It’s great, then we have a business model.
We are cheaper than the diesel system, when the diesel price rises by five percent per year.
And then we started negotiating with the insulaners.
What would all have to be done?
I have negotiated with investors, I have been looking for new partners.
At that time, we were only five people, one to rebuild the society.
Here is the show again.
The brown is the conventional system, the green is our system.
The fact that our system also has a price hike is because we still make twenty percent of diesel and not even a price hike on the other things.
And the power utility, which the power supply company on the island meant, we find that quite great.
We would like to support you, but we don’t believe you can solve the technical problem.
And that’s why we decided to build a hall in Berlin, where we can so-called depict the electrical ratio of the islands on a scale of one to three very accurately.
That is to say, then we first sought to find the largest battery in the world.
Here is she.
It originates naturally from Asia, in the fall from Japan.
And funnyly, it was developed in the 1970s by BBC Mannheim, today ABB, and was then licensed to the Japanese.
You can see, it’s a very, very large battery.
It has a megawatt of power and can deliver that power for six hours, and this is the battery that we have so-called simulation-technically uncovered.
And then they set up.
We also brought one of these diesel aggregates in the same size as it stands there, in the hall, to actually the complete dynamic behavior of this network, so in the hall it looks now so that behind it is the diesel, here is the large battery, here are the whole umrichter, with which we simulate the network.
Here we simulate the entire transmission system, the kilometre-physics of the cable, in order to simulate the vibration behavior in the network.
And here you can see it all again.
We can also turn 200 kilowatts of photovoltaic power into the grid.
Here we see it again here we see the diesel again, here again the whole, the individual aggregates.
And what we did, since two thousand and nine, the hall was then finished, until today, two thousand and twelve, almost everything that was to be developed here between the individual system an electronics, an software, we did.
So we are not a battery manufacturer, but we define ourselves as a company that only stands between the battery theme and the network theme and everything in between.
You must, of course, communicate at the battery, you must also be able to communicate at the net, and that is very complicated.
The beautiful thing is that on this island you can basically foresee today all the problems that we will face if we want to increase our share of renewables.
So this whole discussion, how it is going in the moment, energy shift, how it should go, on the island we have for example for twenty-five to thirty percent excess energy, so we intersect the wind and the sun abregeln.
Of course, then there is a smart-grid.
So smart-grid, a huge theme everywhere.
On the island, we can already begin to integrate electromobility, and we can manage the last one.
That is, if you are renewable at seventy percent, then you will not be able to do this without storage.
You can do it through a smart grid, you can do it through the expansion of the net, yes, you should also do it in any case, listen to it, but you will never be able to complete versions on memory.
And that’s so &apos;n bit the message.
That’s why a lot of people come and look at it, just because you can see what problems you get.
When we turn off the diesel, we no longer have that rotating mass, which causes a certain inertia in the grid.
And our European connectivity network consists basically only of rotating masses of large power plants, where the wave always rotates all over Europe.
We look into this network, see the fifty hertz, and when it turns into forty-nine hertz, we catch a few valves to open, then a little more steam goes back in, and then we get up again.
That is the system.
And of course, it’s incredibly sluggish.
If they drop it somewhere, then it will last &apos;s &apos;ne weile.
The spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the net stable.
And in time, you can react to others again.
If you no longer have that, that rotating mass, then you have to replace that with power electronics and electrochemistry.
And with this large battery, we can turn it off once for two milliseconds.
Then you can see what enormous speed options there are.
And the message is now, we must give up on these rotating masses, if we so-called our goals twenty, twenty, twenty percent, twenty, thirty, thirty percent and so on, if we want to<unk> them at all,
Then we have to reduce our must-run capabilities in the network.
Must-run simply means the power plant is running with to keep that frequency.
Yes, this is a huge debate in the moment, for example from coal-fired power plants, because we do not have any other, or gas turbines, because that is not possible.
And we are simply trying to make it clear that the capacities, which must-run capacities, can be reduced by also bringing electrochemical storage into the net.
Fortunately, there are now a lot of studies on this.
And for this purpose, people always come and look at our test stand, almost our island test stand.
And yes, the discussion is always about the question of how far one can predict a bit of a distant future there.
And many of the discussions I’ve had over the past six years have been similar to the discussion I’ve had over the last thirty years on the topic of photovoltaics.
is schwachsinn, kindergarten, we have everything calculated, it does not calculate itself.
We now have 30 gigawatts of photovoltaic power in Germany.
That is exemplary.
And I simply assume that in the next thirty years we will have the same capacity of electrochemical storage facilities all over the world.
Simply put, so it will come.
There will be a lot of resistance and quarrels.
The beautiful thing is that almost now, in the last two years, I have experienced that the scientists are on my side.
We have now received over ten million forderprojects, including um &apos;ne ten-megawatt battery now ans deutsche netz zu klemmen.
This will take place next April.
Therefore, one also notices that there is a shift and only from this defence to yes, to the idea, a hundred percent renewable yes.
And if you have one hundred percent renewable energy, then it is like a self-reliant system.
So far, in discussions, these insulaners, who make themselves self-sufficient, who have their own small net, which has nothing to do with our union, are always tempted.
The question is quite simple, if they become completely independent of any fossil or uranium energy carriers that are drilled out somewhere in the world and brought to them, then they are an island.
Then they only consume what the sun and wind are there where they live.
And that's so a bit of our vision of a reasonable energy supply and I'm cradle-to-cradle also grateful that you said, use solar energy.
And that’s what we’re doing, and so comes the talk of premium kola, that you can once again be a collective and use solar energy, here a bit together.
And well, I just want to encourage you, in the sense that you can quietly be a little crazy and also have a vision.
And you really have to be quite tough on it, but I think it can be done.
Many thanks.
When Steve Lopez, the columnist of the Los Angeles Times, once walked through the streets in the centre of Los Angeles, he heard a wonderful music.
It came from a man, an African-American, sympathetic, rough, homeless, who played on a geige who had only two sides left.
Many of them will know the story, because from Steve’s article about it was later a book, which in turn was filmed, featuring Robert Downey Junior as Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the counterbassist who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory and whose promising career was tragically ended early by his paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel left Juilliard, suffered a nervous breakdown and 30 years later he lived as a homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I recommend you all to read Steve's Book or watch the movie so that you can understand not only the wonderful connection that has arisen between these two men, but also how the music restored this connection halfway and how it was the instrument, if this play of words is allowed, to crush the mithalf, Nathaniel weg von der Straße.
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's first and fourth symphonies and came behind the stage to introduce himself.
He spoke in a very fierce and celebrity tone about yo-yo ma and Hillary Clinton and about how the dodgers would never get into the baseball world series. and all because of the tückic passage of the first geige in the final set of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.
We came to talk about music, and a few days later I received an email, in which Nathaniel was interested in geigen lessons with me.
I still have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment because he had already been treated with electric shocks and with thorazine and handschellen, a trauma that has followed him all his life.
As a result, he is now<unk> susceptible to these schizophrenic phases, which are sometimes so bad, and he disappears for days, in the streets of Skid Row Herumwandert, always exposed to this horror and the torture of his own minds.
And it was precisely the same phase that Nathaniel was at, when we started our first lesson in the Walt Disney concert hall. he had this crazy flackern in his eyes and seemed completely lost.
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was trying to poison him in his sleep.
I was afraid, not because of me, but I was afraid that I could lose him, that he might sink into one of his states, and that I could destroy his relationship with the geige, if I began to talk about tonleitern and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic geigenpedagogy.
So I just started playing.
I played the first set of Beethoven's violin concert.
And while I was playing, I noticed that in Nathaniel’s eyes a complete change was taking place.
It was, as if it was under the influence of an invisible arsenic stand, a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my play.
Nathaniel’s manic anger turned into understanding, into a quiet curiosity and grace.
And as a miracle, he took his geisha and began, after hearing, to play some clips of violin concerts and then beat me to finish playing them: mendelssohn, tschaikowski, sibelius.
We then began to talk about music, starting with bach over Beethoven, brahms, bruckner and all the other bs, from bartók to hin to esa-pekka salonen.
And I realized that he not only possessed an encyclopedic knowledge about music, but also had a close personal relationship with her.
He spoke of her with a passion and understanding, which I know only from my colleagues at the Philharmonie of Los Angeles.
By playing music and speaking about music, this paranoid, confused man, who had just been dragged through the streets of Los Angeles, became a lover, educator, excellent musician.
Music is medicine, music changes us.
For Nathaniel, music means mental health.
Because music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real.
And so he escapes from his tormenting states.
I understood that this was precisely the essence of art.
This is precisely the reason why we make music: so that we can shape something that is deep inside us all, our feelings, through our artistic lenses, through our creativity to reality.
And the reality of that expression reaches us all, and moves, inspires, and unites us.
Nathaniel was anging, so the music brought him back to a community of friends.
The redemptive power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him, who recognized his talent and respected him.
And I will always music with Nathaniel, whether in the Walt Disney concert hall or in the skid row, because it reminds me why I became a musician.
Many thanks.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you very much.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I want to play something that I unshamelessly stole the cellist.
I hope you will forgive me.
So I’ve known a lot of fish in my life.
I have only two lovers.
This first, it was more like a passionate affair.
It was a nice fish, tasty, good consistency, contentful, a bestseller on the menu.
What a fish.
Even better, it has been grown in aquaculture according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability.
You could also feel good about selling it.
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day the head of the company called and asked if I could give a lecture on the sustainability of the farm at an event.
&quot; of course &quot;, I said.
Here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our kitchens. how do we keep fish on our menu cards?
Over the past 50 years, we have fished the seas as we have hit the woods.
It is difficult to overestimate the destruction.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones we love, the tuna, the salmon, the salmon, the swordfish, they are broken together.
There is almost nothing left.
So well or bad aquaculture, fish farming, will be part of our future.
Fish farming plants pollute the environment, most of them in any case, and they are inefficient, let us take tuna. a big disadvantage.
It has a feed value of 15 to 1.
That is, 15 pounds of wild fish are needed in order to get one pound of zucht-thunfish.
Not very sustainable.
It doesn’t taste very good either.
So here was finally a company that tried to do it right.
I wanted to support you.
The day before the event, I called the head of public service for the company.
We call him Don.
&quot; don &quot;, I said, &quot;just to have the facts right, you are famous for growing so far outside in the sea that you do not pollute the environment. &quot;
“This is true,” he said. “we are so far outside that the waste from our fish is distributed, not concentrated.”
And then he added, &quot;We are basically our own world.
This feed value is from 2.5 to 1 &quot;, he said.
&quot; the best in the industry. &quot;
2.5 to one, great.
&quot; 2.5 to one was? was you feeding? &quot;
&quot;sustainable protein &quot;, he said.
&quot;great &quot;, I said.
And that evening I lay in bed and thought: What hell is a sustainable protein?
So I called on the next day, just before the event, don an.
I said: &quot;don, what are sustainable proteins for example? &quot;
He said, “I don’t know, I’ll ask you.
No one could give me a decent answer until I finally called the chief biologist.
We also call him Don.
&quot; don &quot;, I said, &quot; what are sustainable proteins for example? &quot;
Now, he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal, and then he said, hyhnchen-pellets.
I said: &quot;hyhnchen-pellets? &quot;
he said: &quot;Yes, federn, haut, knochenmehl, reste, getrocknet und zu Futter processed. &quot;
I said &quot;How much percentage of your furters is hyhnchen? &quot;,
In the assumption of maybe two percent.
&quot; well, that’s about 30 percent &quot;, he said.
I said, “Don, what is sustainable about feeding a fish?”
There was a long pause in the management and he said: "There is just too much chicken in the world."
I fell in love with this fish.
No, not, because I am a self-righteous pleasant and good man.
I am even that.
No, I have actually disliked this fish because, I swear by God, the fish has tasted after this entertainment.
This second fish is a different kind of love story.
It’s the romantic art, the art, the better you get to know your fish, the more you love the fish.
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain.
A friend of a journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time.
In a way, it has connected us.
He came to the table with a bright, fast shimmering white color.
The cockerel had sold him.
Stop twice.
Surprisingly, war is still delicious.
Who can make a fish taste so good after it has been sold?
I can’t, but this guy can.
We call him Miguel, and his real name is Miguel.
And no, he has not cooked the fish and he is not a cook. at least in the way you and I understand it.
He is a biologist at veta la palma.
This is a fish breeding in the southwestern corner of the Spaniards.
It is located near the mouth of the Guadalquivir rivers.
Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of Argentinians.
They raised meat-straws on them, which were basically wetlands.
They did this by draining the land.
They built this complicated sequence of canals, and they pushed water out of the land and out into the river.
Well, they couldn’t make it work, not economically.
Ecologically, it was a disaster.
It brought about 90 percent of the birds, which is a lot of birds for this place.
And so in 1982 a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land.
What have you done?
They have reversed the flow of waters.
They literally wrapped the hatchback.
Instead of draining the water out, they use the channels to bring the water back in.
They float the channels.
They created 11,000 hectares of fish farming – barsch, meeräsche, garnele, aal – and by doing so, miguel and his company have completely reversed the ecological destruction.
The farm is incredible.
I mean, you’ve never seen anything like that before.
They look out at the horizon, which is a million miles away, and all they see are flooded canals and this dense, lush march.
I was there not a long time ago with Miguel.
Er is an incredible guy, three parts Charles Darwin and one part &quot;a crocodile to kiss&quot;.
Okay, we were fighting through the wetlands and I choke and sweat, have matsch bis to my knees, and miguel holds a biology lecture in peace.
Here you have a rare glider emerge.
Now mentioned are the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
And here, he sees a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe.
It turns out that Miguel spent most of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became such a fish expert.
He said, “I don’t know anything about fish.
I am an expert in relationships. &quot;
And then it goes and plunges into more gerades of rare birds and algae and strange water plants.
And don’t misunderstand me, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, so in the art.
It’s great, but I was in love.
And my head became weak over this sold piece of delicious fish that I had the night before.
I said, “Miguel, why is it that your fish tastes so good?”
He pointed to the algae.
I know, young man, the algae, the phytoplankton, the reliefs, that’s incredible.
But what do your fish eat?
How is the feed valuation? &quot;
Now, it is hard to tell me that it is such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild.
the plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, that is what feeds the fish.
The system is so healthy, it is entirely self-developing.
There is no feed.
Do you belong to a farm that does not feed its animals?
Later in the day, I drove on this plot with miguel herum and I asked him, I said: &quot;For a place that seems so natural &quot;, unlike any farm I've been to, &quot;How do you miss success? &quot;;
In that moment, it was as if a film director wanted a stage change.
And we bowed around the corner and got the most incredible sight, thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literal pinker carpet as far as the eye can reach.
&quot; that is success &quot;, he said.
“Look at her beech, pink.
She shrieked. &quot;
I was completely confused.
I said, “Miguel, don’t they smell your fish?”
&quot; yes &quot;, he said.
We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish seeds to the birds.
Last year, there were 600,000 birds on this plot, more than 250 different species.
It has now become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe.
I said, “Miguel, isn’t a well-developed stock of birds the last thing you want to have on a fish breeding?”
He shrugged his head, no.
He said: “We build extensively, not intensely.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the garnals.
These garlics eat the phytoplankton.
The more pink the abdomen, the better the system. &quot;
Okay, let’s rethink it: a farm that doesn’t feed its animals and a farm that loses its success on the health of its predators.
A fish breeding site, but also a bird reserve.
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos from vornherein shouldn’t even be there.
They live in a town 240 kilometers away, where the soil quality is better for nesting.
One morning they flew 240 kilometers to the farm.
And one night, they fly 240 kilometers back.
They do this because they can follow the streaked white line of the A92 road.
In seriousness.
I had imagined an art journey of the penguins, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, “Miguel, do you fly 240 kilometers to the farm and then fly 240 kilometers back in the evening?
Do you do this for the children? &quot;
He looked at me as if I had just quoted a song by Whitney Houston.
He said, “No. They do this because the food is better.”
I haven't mentioned the skin of my favorite fish, which was delicious, and I don't like fischhaut .I don't like it sautiert .I don't like it crusprig .
It’s that bitter, choked taste.
I don’t love it fast.
And yet, when I tried it at this restaurant in southern Spain, it didn’t taste fischhaut at all.
It tasted sweet and pure, as if you were taking a bite from the ocean.
I mentioned this to Miguel and is nickte.
He said: &quot;The head acts like a sponge.
It is the last defense before anything enters the body.
it has evolved in the course of evolution, in order to remove impurities. &quot;
And then he added: “But our water has no impurities.”
A farm that doesn’t feed its fish, a farm that misses its success on the success of its predators.
And then I realized, when he said, that a farm, which has no impurities, is undermining him enormously, because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir river into it.
It is a flow that carries all those things with it, from which the streams today tend to carry them with them, chemical pollutants, outflows of pesticides.
And if it has fought through the system and it leaves it, the water is cleaner, as if it had come in.
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.
So not just a farm that does not feed its animals, not just a farm that loses its success on the health of its predators, but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant, and not only for these fish, but also for you and me.
For when the water flows out, it sinks into the Atlantic.
A drop in the ocean, I know, but I take it, and you should also do that, because this love story, however romantic, is also an opschlussreich.
One could say that she is a recipe for the future good food, whether we speak of barsch or fleischrindern.
What we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture, of one in which food actually tastes good.
But for many people, this is a bit too radical.
We are not realists, we are geniuses, we are lovers.
we love weekly markets . we love small family<unk> . we talk about regional foods . we eat bio .
And when they claim that these are the things that assure the future of good foods, someone stands up somewhere and says, "Hey guys, I love pinke flamingos, but how will they feed the world?
How will they feed the world? &quot;
Can I be honest?
I don’t like this question.
No, not, because we already produce enough calories to nourish the world more than just feed.
One billion people are starving today.
One billion — which is more than ever before — due to more drastic inequalities in distribution, not in total production.
Well, I don’t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system over the past 50 years.
We are feeding grain and vegetables, pesticides and monocultures, chemicals and fish, and all the time the agricultural industry has simply asked: “If we feed more people cheaper, how terrible can that be?”
That was the motive; it was the justification; it was the business plan of American agriculture.
We should call it what it is, a trade in development, a trade that quickly refreshes the ecological capital that makes this production possible.
This is not a business, and it is not agriculture.
Our crop chamber is now threatened, not because of weakening resources, but because of weakening resources.
Not by the latest mehdrescher and tractor inventions, but by fertile land, not by pumps, but by fresh water, not by chain saws, but by forests, and not by fishing boats and networks, but by fish in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let us start with the question: how will we feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself?
In order to do this, do not look at the agricultural industry model for the future.
It’s really everything, and it’s done.
Capital, chemistry and machinery are on top of it, and it has never produced anything really good to eat.
Let’s look at the ecological model instead.
That’s what goes back to two billion years of work experience.
look at Miguel an, Bauern as Miguel,
farms, which are not worlds in themselves, farms, which restore rather than use, farms, which cultivate extensively rather than only intensively, Bauerns, who are not only cultivators, but experts for relationships,
Because they are the ones who are also experts in taste.
And if I’m really honest, you’re a better cowboy than I’ll ever be.
You know, that’s right for me, because if that’s the future good food, it will be delicious.
Thank you thanks.
If I want to bring you one thing today, it is that the totality of the data we consume is greater than the sum of its individual parts, and instead of thinking about information overload, I want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns arise and we recognize trends that would otherwise not have become visible.
So what we see here is a typical sterbediagram after alter angeordnet.
The program I’m using here is a small experiment.
It’s called a pivot, and what I can do with a pivot is that I can filter after a certain cause, let’s say an accident.
And immediately I see another pattern, which arises.
And that’s because in the middle area here people are the most active and they are the most vulnerable here.
We can go a step further and then rearrange the data and see that circulatory diseases and cancers are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.
If we go further and sort by age, we say 40 years or younger, we see that accidents are even the main cause of concern.
And whoever researches further sees that this is especially true for men.
They also recognize that looking at information and data in this way reminds us very much of swimming in a vibrant information graph.
And if we can do this for rohdaten, why not for the content itself?
What we now have here are the title images of each individual &quot;sports illustrated &quot;, that have ever been printed.
It’s all online, it’s all online.
You may like to test it after my presentation in your rooms.
With pivot, you can immerse yourself in a decade.
You can be immersed in a particular year.
You can jump directly to a specific expenditure.
Now when I look here, I see the athletes who appear in this edition and the sports.
I am a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I click here, which shows me all the editions in which Lance Armstrong is mentioned.
Now, if I just want to get a broader overview, I might think &quot;ok, what if I look at everything with the theme of cycling? &quot;
So I take a step back and broaden that sight.
Now I see Greg Lemond.
And so you get an idea that when you search for information in this way, target, broaden, reinzoomen, rousezoomen, then you do not search or simply surf.
You do something that is actually a little different.
It is something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used.
I would like to carry this idea a little further with something that is a bit crazy.
What we’ve done here is, we’ve taken every single Wikipedia page and reduced it to a small summary.
The summary contains a brief overview and a symbol for the area from which it comes.
I’m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular Wikipedia sites.
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
Immediately we get an impression of the topics that are most popular on Wikipedia.
I will now vote on the topic of "government".
Now, after I have chosen the government, I realize that the Wikipedia categories that most cover time magazines are people of the years.
This is really important, as this is a recognition, which is not stuck in a single Wikipedia page.
This can only be realized by taking a step back and looking at the whole thing.
Looking at one of these summaries, I can then see in the theme of time magazines &quot;menchen des jahres &quot;hinein gehen &quot; and all together.
Now, when I look at all these people, I realize that most of them are government officials; some come from science; some, even less, from the economy; here is my boss; and one comes from the music industry.
Interestingly, Bono is also a Ted Prize winner.
So we can now jump and take a look at all the Ted Prize winners.
You see, we browse the net for the first time as if it is also really a net, not only side by side, but much more abstract.
And so I would like to show you something else that could be a small surprise.
I’m just showing you here the New York Times website.
pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view websites with it -- and we bring this zoom technology to every single web page like this.
I can also take a step back and jump directly to a specific section.
This is important because it is only by looking at websites in this way that one can look at the entire internet flow in the same way.
I can also in my course hineinzoomen in a particular timeframe.
Here is the stand of the whole demonstration that I have held until now.
And I can, so to speak, take back everything I’ve seen so far.
And, if I take a step out again and look at everything, I can rearrange my course<unk> according to my such-passage. here, I have sought for nepotistisch, here for bing, or here for live labs pivot.
And from here, I can go into that site and call you again.
It is a metaphor that is repeatedly used, and each time it makes the overall picture larger than the sum of the data parts.
At the moment, in this world, we think that data is a curse.
We are talking about the curse of information overflows.
we reden vom &quot; ertinken in information &quot;.
What if we could reverse this situation and put the internet on our heads, so that instead of always going from one thing to another, we begin to be able to go from many things to many things, and thus recognize patterns that would otherwise remain hidden?
If we can do this, then this previous data trap will become,<unk> a new source of more meaningful information.
Instead of merely moving in the information, we can get knowledge from it.
And if we know experience, then maybe we can even draw wisdom out of it.
I stop listening, thank you very much.
I grew up with a decent portion of science fiction.
In my school time, I take the bus to school, one day, an hour per route.
And my nose was always stuck in a book, a science fiction book, which hijacked my thoughts into other worlds and narratively satisfied my deep inside, insatiable curiosity.
This curiosity was also shown in the fact that whenever I was not in school, I travelled through the streams of the woods, wandered and collected samples, frogs and snakes and beetles and teichwasser, brought everything home and looked under the microscope.
I was a passionate scientist, you know.
It was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the possible.
And my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment, because then, in the late 1960s, we flew to the mouth and explored the deep sea.
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating messages, showing us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we could never have imagined before.
I think that’s well suited to that science fiction role.
And I was an artist.
I could draw, I could paint.
And since there were neither video games, nor this translation of computer-generated films, nor the whole picture language in the media landscape, I had to create those images in my head.
When we read a book as children, we took the description of the author and projected it onto the canvas in our heads.
My reaction to this was drawing and painting of alien, alien worlds, robots, spacecraft and all that.
In mathematics teaching I was constantly erwischt from the teacher, as I, in the end of the lehrbuch hidden, herummalte.
That creativity had to be stopped somehow.
What fascinated me was the thought of an unknown world here on our own earth.
I<unk> would never reach an alien world with a spacecraft. that seemed to me quite unlikely.
But here was a world that I could actually enter, here on earth, and it was as fascinating and exotic as all that I had always imagined when I read these books.
So I decided, when I was 15, to become a taucher.
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada, 1,000 km from the next ocean.
But I did not let myself be discouraged by that.
I was upset by my father, until he finally found a school in Buffalo, New York, on the other side of the border, where we lived.
I made my badge in a swimming pool in the middle of the winter in Buffalo, New York.
But the ocean, a real ocean, did not come to mind until two years later, when we moved to California.
Since then, in the 40 years, I have spent approximately 3,000 hours under water, 500 hours of which in tauchbooten.
And I have learned that the world of the deep seas, even in the flat ocean, is so rich in fascinating life that we can hardly really imagine it.
The imagination of nature knows no boundaries, in contrast to our own unfortunate human imagination.
To this day, I feel the deepest fear for what I see on my tauchgängen.
And my love for the ocean continues, with the same intensity as you.
When I thought of myself as an adult, it was filmmaking.
This seemed to be the best way, my inner urge to tell stories, to create images, to combine them with my need.
As a child, I was constantly drawing comic books and so on.
So there were films along the way, pictures and stories brought together.
Of course, the stories I was looking for were from the science fiction field: &quot; terminator &quot;, &quot; aliens &quot;, &quot; abyss &quot;.
At &quot;abyss &quot; I was able to combine my love for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking.
So my two passions were almost intertwined.
Something interesting happened at the "abyss": in order to solve a narrative problem in this film - and indeed we had to create such an art of fluid waterways - we grabbed computer-generated animation, cg, back.
It was the first computer-generated soft-surface figure to be seen in a movie.
Although the film did not bring any money, in fact, it just played its production costs, but I noticed something fascinating: the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that came out of it.
According to Arthur Clarke’s Law, advanced technology and magic are no longer distinguishable.
They also saw something magical.
And I found it incredibly exciting.
And I thought: &quot;Wow, that must definitely be included in the film art. &quot;
So we went in &quot;Terminator 2 &quot;, my next movie, even further.
Together with the air we created the type there from liquid metal. the success depends entirely on how this effect would come.
And it worked. again we had created something magical . and the effect in the audience was dieselbe . however we have already earned a little more money with the film .
From these two experiences, a whole new world was reached, a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers.
So I founded a company, along with my good friend Stan Winston, who at that time was the best make-up and creature designer.
The basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with optical printers etc. and immediately start with digital productions.
We did so then, and provided us with a competitive advantage for such a time.
But not in the 1990s, we noticed that we were advancing too slowly in creature and character design – for which we had actually founded the company.
I had written this piece of avatar, which was to push the mess in the matter of visual effects and computer-generated effects to entirely new heights, with realistic human, expressive characters produced using cg. and the main characters should all be cg. and the world should be cg.
And the people in my company told me that for the time being we are not in a position to do that.
So I shifted that and made this other film about the big ship that is sinking.
The film studio sold this as Romeo and Juliet on a ship and it became a love film of epic scale, a passionate film.
In secret, however, I actually wanted to descend to the real wreck of the Titanic.
So I made that movie.
That’s the truth, but the studio didn’t know it.
But I persuaded them by saying, “We’re diving into the wrack.
We will show it in the opening sequence of the films.
It’s a good hangover for marketing. &quot;
And I convinced you to fund an expedition.
It sounds crazy, but this goes back to the fact that your own imagination can create a reality.
We then actually created a reality six months later, in which I found myself in a Russian tauchboat, four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic, and I was staring at the real Titanic through a bullauge.
It wasn’t a movie, it wasn’t HD, it was real.
So, that really caught me up.
We had to build cameras and mirrors and everything possible.
And I noticed how much these deep-sea dives resembled a space mission.
Yes, they were also highly technological and more ambitious in planning.
If you climb into this capsule, then you swim down into this dark, hostile environment, where there is no hope for salvation if you do not regain it yourself.
And I thought, “Wow, that’s just like I’m in a science fiction movie.
That’s really cool. &quot;
I was really obsessed with exploring the deep seas.
At least from the part that has to do with curiosity and science. it was everything. it was adventure, it was curiosity. it was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature for which we could then create a visual effect. but I couldn’t imagine what I would see outside the windows.
In some of the subsequent expeditions I have seen beings in thermal springs, and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had ever seen before, and for which science had not yet found words at the time when we saw them.
That really turned me around, and I wanted more.
And then I made a somewhat unusual decision.
After the success of “Titanic,” I said to myself, “Okay, I’ll put my main profession as a filmmaker in Hollywood on this job and I’ll be a full-time researcher for a while.”
And then we started, we stumbled into the “Bismarck” and explored it with robot vehicles.
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic.
We took small robots, which we had built, that were a fiber-glass cable.
Our intention was to dive inside and look at the interior of the ship, which had never been done before.
No one had ever explored the inside of the wreckage. there were no means yet to do so. so we developed the necessary technology.
And now I sit on the deck of the Titanic, in a tauchboat, and see boards that are pretty similar to this brettern here, and of which I know that the band once played there.
And I’m flying with a small robot vehicle through the gangs of the ship.
I actually only operate it, but my consciousness is inside the vehicle.
It felt like I was physically inside the shipwrecks of the Titanic present.
This was the most surreal form of a déjà-vu I’ve ever experienced, because before I went around a corner, I always knew what would immediately appear in the light kegel of the vehicle, as I had been running over the set of films for months when we were filming the film.
The set was, in fact, an exact copy of the ship's plan.
It was a very strange experience.
She made me aware of this telepresence experience that one can use such robotic avatars and thus embarrass one’s own consciousness in the vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was indeed an enormous deep grip.
And maybe even a small look at what might happen in a few decades if you have a cyborg body to explore something or do other things, in all possible post-human future scenarios, which I can imagine as a science fiction fan.
After these expeditions, we began to truly appreciate what we had seen below, for example these deep-sea springs, where we saw these incredibly astonishing animals.
They live with the help of chemosynthesis.
They do not exist in a system based on sunlight, as we do.
And so you can see animals, which right next to 500 degrees Celsius say that they can survive there.
At the same time, I was also very interested in space science, which was again the science fiction influence from my childhood.
And so I landed with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with NASA and who sit in the NASA Expert Council and plan proper space missions. they go to Russia, pass through the biomedical protocol and all the drums before the mission, then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them.
It was fascinating.
But I still love it besides that I took space scientists with us in the depths.
I took them with me and gave them access to the world below: astrobiologists, planet scientists, people who were interested in such extreme situations. I took them to the sources with me so they could look around, take samples, test instruments, and so on.
Although we are making documentaries, we are actually doing science, more precisely: worldroom science.
So the circle closed between my existence as a science fiction fan, then as a child, and my implementation into reality.
In the course of this journey of discovery, I have learned a lot.
I’ve learned a lot about science, but now I think you’re sure, a director must also be able to lead, a leader like a ship captain or so.
I did not understand much of the leadership before I embarked on these expeditions.
For at a certain point I had to say to myself: &quot;what am I doing here?
Why do I do that? what comes out of it? &quot;
These foolish films don’t bring us any money.
We’re just playing the cost of production. von Ruhm no spur.
Everyone thinks I’m between “Titanic” and “Avatar” and I’d missed somewhere that nail on a towel on the beach.
I have made all these films, these documentaries, for a very small audience.
No glory, no honor, no money.
You do it because of the task you want, because of the challenge you want - and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists. you do it because of the discovery noise, and because of the strange connection that arises when a small group of people form a team.
For we have done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked together uninterruptedly for years. sometimes we have been at sea for 2 to 3 consecutive months.
And in this community one realizes that the most important thing is the respect that one has for one another, because one has dealt with a task that one cannot explain to anyone else.
When one returns to land and says, “We had to do it, the fiberglass, the schallschwächung, and the whole drumherum, the whole technique, and the difficulties, the human performance, when one works at sea,” then one simply cannot explain the other.
There is a connection, a mutual respect.
So when I came back to shoot my next film “Avatar,” I tried to use the same leadership style, namely that one respects his team and in return deserves its respect.
This really changed the dynamics.
Then I stand again with a small team on unknown terrain. we shoot &quot;avatar &quot; with a new technique, which did not exist before.
Incredibly exciting.
An enormous challenge.
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years.
This changed my art of making films, completely.
There were people who thought that we had really well imitated these ocean creatures and transported them to the planet Pandora.
For me, it was more a principled art to do my job, the actual process that has changed in the outcome.
So what can we conclude from all this?
What lessons have we learned?
I think, an erster star stands the curious.
It is the most powerful human attribute.
Our imagination is a force that can even create a reality.
And the respect of your teams is more important than all the lobsters in this world.
Young filmmakers come to me and say, “Give me a rat how I can do something like this.”
And I say, &quot;Do not limit yourself.
Do not bet on yourself, do not bet against yourself, but take risks on yourself.
NASA has such a favourite phrase: &quot;Failure is no alternative. &quot;
But in art and in exploration, failure must be an alternative, because there it guarantees a trust boost.
No important undertaking, which innovation required, was approached without risk.
You have to be prepared to take such risks.
This is the idea that I would like to give you along the way. failure is quite an alternative, but fear is not. thank you.
Today I’m talking to you about energy and climate.
And this may be a bit surprising, because my full-time employment at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and sickness medicines, the things we need to invent and supply to enable the poorest 2 billion a better life.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, precisely even more important than for anyone else on the planet.
Climate deterioration means that their seeds will not grow over many years; we will rain too much or too little; these things will change as much as their fragile environment cannot withstand.
This leads to starvation; it leads to uncertainty; it leads to unrest.
So, climate change will be terrible for them.
In addition, the energy price is very important for them.
The fact is that if you could only reduce the price from one bag, to reduce poverty, energy would be by far the most efficient.
The price of energy has fallen over that time.
In fact, the progressive society is based on energy advances.
The coal revolution triggered the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century there was a rapid fall in the price of electricity and therefore we have refrigerators, air conditioning, we can repair modern materials and do so many things.
We also find ourselves in a wonderful situation with current in the rich world.
But when we lower the price – let’s halve the price – we encounter a new barrier and that barrier is linked to CO2.
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually fairly clear.
They sum up the CO2 emission, which leads to the temperature rise and this temperature rise has some very negative effects on the weather and<unk> worse, which indirectly results in the natural ecosystems not being able to adapt to such rapid changes and thus entire systems collapse.
Now, the exact correlation between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change and where their further consequences lie, there are some uncertainties, but not very many.
And there is<unk> uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be, but they will be extremely bad!
I have asked the top scientists several times: &quot;Do we really need to come down to near zero?
Is not half or a quarter enough? &quot;
The answer is: until we get close to zero, the temperature will continue to rise.
That is why it is a big challenge.
It is quite different than to say, we have a 3.5-meter-high truck, which must be under a 3-meter bridge here.
It has to go downwards, to zero.
Every year, we emit more than 26 billion tons of carbon dioxide.
Every American weighs approximately 20 tons. people from Armenian countries, less than one.
On average, it’s about 5 tons per person on the planet.
And somehow we have to bring about changes that bring it down to zero.
It has been constantly managed so far.
Only various economic changes have affected it at all and we must go from rapid increase to decrease and to a decrease to zero.
This equation has four factors . a little multiplication . they have this thing links - co2 - that they want to bring direction null and that will depend on the number of people , the services that each person uses on average , the average energy for each service and the CO2 emitted per energy unit .
So let’s look at one factor by one and consider how we get that to zero.
Probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero.
Well, this is basic algebra, but let’s go through it.
First we have the people.
Today there are 6.8 billion people.
And it is rising to 9 billion. which is moving to 9 billion.
If we are very successful with new vaccines, health care and reproductive medicine, we could probably reduce that by 10% to 15%, but at the moment we see a rise of 1.3%.
The second factor is the services we use.
This includes everything that we eat, we eat, clothes, television, heating.
These are very good things, and poverty reduction means making these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet.
It’s great that this number is rising.
In the rich world, in the upper billions, we could<unk> abstract and use less, but on average this number will rise every year and thus more than double the total number of services provided per person.
Here we see a very basic service. is there a light at home so you can read the homework?
And these students don’t have it, so they go out and read their schoolwork under the street light.
Now, when it comes to efficiency, the energy per service, there are finally good news.
We have something that does not rise,
Due to various successes in the lighting sector, through other car types, through new methods in the house building, there are many services, the energy consumption of which some individual services can be reduced by 90%.
In other services, such as the manufacture of cartridges, 105 00 : 05 : 56,000 - &amp; gt; 00 : 05 : 58,000 or the air transport or air transport, there is much less room for improvements.
Overall, if we are optimistic, we may get a reduction by a factor 3 or maybe even by a factor 6.
But with regard to the first three factors, we have now gone from 26 billion to<unk> the best 13 billion tons.
So let’s look at the fourth factor – and this will be a key factor – that is, the amount of CO2 emitted per energy unit.
The question arises whether it can get it to zero.
If they burn coal: no.
If they burn natural gas: no.
Fast every recovery method for electricity emits CO2 today, except for renewable energy and nuclear energy.
So what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system.
We need energy wonders.
When I use the term ‘wunder’, I don’t mean the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle, the PC is a miracle.
The Internet and its services are a miracle.
The people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders.
Normally, there is no deadline for a miracle up to a specific date.
Normally, one is almost just standing in the daneben and some come, others don’t.
In this case, however, we must give full gas and get a miracle in a very short time.
Now, I ask myself, how can I really bring this over?
Is there a natural illustration, a demonstration, that creates the imagination of the people here?
I remember last year, when I brought mosquitoes and somehow people liked it.
When the idea became really tangible for them, they know that there are people who live with mosquitoes.
For energy, I got it here.
I decided that the release of my annual contribution to the environment would be here.
Here are also a few natural glühwürmchen.
I’ve been assured that they won’t bite; in fact, they probably won’t even get out of the glass.
Well, there are all kinds of gaming solutions like these, but they all don’t bring much.
We need solutions, either one or several that have an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability, and although there are many directions in which people look for them, I really see only five that can afford these large demands.
I have spilled out marshes, geothermal, fusion and biofuels.
These may allow a moderate contribution and if they do better than I expect, it would be great, but my core statement here is that we must work on all of those five, and we can not give up any of them because they intimidate us, because all have significant problems.
Let us first look at the combustion of fossil fuels, the combustion of either coal or natural gas.
What you have to do there may seem simple, but it is not. you would have to capture all the CO2 that comes out of the shornstone after you burn it, liquid it under pressure and then store it somewhere and hope it stays there.
There are some pilot projects that do this at a 60% - 80% level, but getting it to 100% will be very difficult. and reaching an agreement for the storage of CO2 is a big challenge. but the biggest problem here is the storage time issue.
Who will ensure it?
Who can guarantee something that is literally many billions of times bigger than any kind of garbage that one can imagine from nuclear and other things?
This is a lot of volume.
This is a hard nuts.
Next: Nuclear energy.
It also has three major problems. the costs, especially in highly regulated countries, are high. the question of security, that one really feels that nothing can go wrong, despite the human collaboration, that the fuel is not used for weapons.
So what do you do with that rubbish?
Although it is not very large, there are a lot of concerns.
So there are three very difficult problems, which may be solvable, and on which one should therefore work.
I have summarized the last three of the five.
These are the renewable energy sources, as they are often called.
And they also have – although it’s great that they don’t need fuel – they have a few nights.
On the one hand, the energy density generated by these technologies is dramatically smaller than that of power plants.
These are energy farms, one speaks of many square kilometers, a thousand times more area than a normal power plant.
In addition, these sources are subject to interruptions:
The sun does not appear the whole day, it does not appear every day, and the wind does not hurt all the time.
Therefore, if one depends on these sources, one must have a way to get energy even in times when it is not available.
If we say, for example, that the energy source lies outside the country, they not only need the technology, they also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where else.
And there is the storage problem.
And in order to show the dimension, I have looked at all types of batteries that are being manufactured: those for cars, computers, phones, flashlights, for everything. and I have compared that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses.
So we need a big breakthrough here, something that will be about a factor 100 better than the approaches at the moment.
It’s not impossible, but it’s not so easy.
This happens when one tries to bring these interrupted sources over, say, 20% - 30% of the consumption.
If you want to rely on it 100%, you need an incredible wonder battery.
Now, where should we go: what is the right approach?
a &quot;Manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the soul ?
What we need is a lot of companies working on it.
In one of these five areas, we need at least 100 people.
Many will say, “They’re crazy!
I think, here in the Ted group there are many who are already engaged there.
Bill gross has several companies, including a name esolar that has great solar thermal technologies.
Vinod Khosla has invested in dozens of companies that do great things and have interesting opportunities and I try to support that.
Nathan myhrvold and I are funding a company that,<unk> surprisingly, pursues the nuclear approach.
There are some innovations in the nuclear field; modular, liquid.
The development has stopped in this industry some time ago, so it is not a big surprise that some good concepts lie around.
The terrapower concept means that instead of a portion of uranium, one percent of the U235, we decided to burn the 99 percent of the U238.
This is a pretty crazy idea.
But in fact, one had thought about it for a long time, but one could never rationally simulate whether it would work, but since there is a modern supercomputer, one can simulate it and see that, yes, with the right materials, it looks like it works.
And because you burn that 99 percent, the cost profile is much better.
In fact, you burn the garbage, and you can even use the waste from today’s reactors as fuel.
Instead of breaking your head over it, just burn it.
The uranium is being consumed gradually, a bit like a candle.
They see that it is an art pillar, often referred to as the "Wandernde Welle Reactor".
This really solves the fuel problem.
Here is a picture of a town in Kentucky.
This is the waste, which 99% . you have the portion that is burned today, taken out so it is called used uranium.
This is the tribe that the U.S. for hundreds of years.
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and simply, you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet’s life.
You know, there are still many challenges there, but it is an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward.
Let’s think about how we should measure our success.
How should our testimony look?
Now, let’s go to the soul we need to reach, and then we talk about the intermediate step.
Many talk about an 80% reduction by 2050.
It is really very important that we get there.
The remaining 20% will be produced in armen ländern, as well as still some agriculture. hopefully waldrohdung and cement will be cleaner until then.
So, in order to reach this 80%, the industrialized countries, including countries such as China, must completely restore their electricity generation.
The other note says whether we use the zero-emission technology, whether it is used in all developed countries and whether we are on the way to get it to the rest.
This is super important.
This will be a key element of this testimony.
If we go back from there, what should the 2020 witness look like?
It should contain the two elements again.
We should use the efficiency measures to bring reduction on the road. the less we emit, the lower the sum of CO2 and thus the temperature will be.
But in fact, this note for the things we undertake, which do not completely lead to the large reductions, is only the same, or even slightly less important than the other, which represents the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs.
We have to track these breakthroughs with full gas and we can measure this: in company figures, in pilot projects and regulatory changes.
There are many great books on this subject.
Das al gore buch &quot;we have the wahl &quot; and David McKays &quot;sustainable energy without the hot air. &quot;
They really go through it and create a framework in which this can be discussed widely, because we need support from all sides to do so.
There are some things that need to come together.
That is a wish.
There is a very concrete desire that we invent this technology.
If you only grant me one wish for the next 50 years, I could choose the president, a vaccine, and that I love, or I could choose that wish, which is, half the price of energy without CO2 is invented.
This has the greatest impact.
If we do not fulfill this desire, there will be a grave between long-term and short-term thinking people, between the United States and China, between poor and rich countries, and almost all of the lives of these 2 billion will be much worse.
So what do we have to do?
What measures do I appeal to?
We need to invest more research funding.
When countries meet in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn’t just talk about CO2.
They should discuss this innovation strategy and they would be shocked by the ridiculous little money spent on these innovative approaches.
We need market gains, co2 steuern, cap & amp; trade something that a price signal schafft.
We need to spread this message.
We need to conduct a more rational and comprehensive dialogue, as well as the things undertaken by the government.
It is an important wish, but I think we can fulfill it.
Many thanks.
Many thanks.
Thank you! thank you!
Just to understand Terrapower a little better – first, can you give us an idea of the magnitude of this investment?
Bill Gates: In order to carry out the simulation on a supercomputer, all the great scientists get what we have done, we only need a few 10 million. and even if we have tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it rationally works, you are only in the 100 million.
The difficult step is to build the first reactor, find the other billions, the regular ones, and the place where the first reactor is actually built.
Once the first is done, if it runs as promised, then everything is quite clear, because the economy, the energy density is as different as nuclear energy, as we know it.
To understand this correctly: does this mean building deep in the ground like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel, this consumed uranium, and then the process begins above and works further down?
bg: exactly. today you always have to refill the reactor, so there are a lot of people and a lot of controls that can go wrong. this thing where you open it and bring things in or out. that's not good!
But if you have very cheap fuel, you can fill it for 60 years — think of a pillar — that you buried it, without all that complexity.
And it sits there and burns for 60 years and then it’s done.
a nuclear reactor, which itself provides a solution for the garbage.
What happens to the garbage: you can put it down—there is much less garbage with this method—then take it and pack it in the next reactor and burn it on.
And we start by taking the rubbish that already exists, which lies in that refrigerator or dry tank next to that reactor.
So what was a problem for these reactors is what we fill in and thus the waste volume is dramatically reduced during this process.
But while you have talked to different people in the world about these possibilities,
Where is the greatest interest, so what really to implement?
bg: now we haven’t fixed ourselves on one place yet and there are a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that ‘nuclear’ carries in the name. there is great interest and the people of the company were in Russia, India, China ... I was here and I met the Minister of Energy and talked about how this fits the energy agenda.
You know, the French and the Japanese have done something in that direction.
This is a variant of a bag that has been made.
This is an important step forward, but it is like a faster reactor and some countries have built it, so anyone who has implemented a faster reactor is a candidate for our first.
in their imagination: the timeframe and probability of calling such a thing really into life?
bg: Now we need one of those scalable, power-generating things that are very inexpensive, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use.
This is almost the deadline, which has shown us the environmental models that we must abide by.
And, you know, terrapower, if everything goes well, and that is a big wish, could easily keep that.
And fortunately, there are dozens of companies today, and we need hundreds who, just as, if their approaches work, that promotion works for their pilots, can contribute to it.
And it would be best if it worked for several, because then one could use a mixture.
In any case, we need a solution.
With regard to the great possible breakthroughs, is this the greatest thing you know?
bg: an energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
This would have been the case without the environmental challenge, but that makes it even more important.
In the nuclear sector, there are other innovative companies.
You know, we do not know their work as well as this one, but there is the modular method, which is another approach.
There is a liquid reactor type, which seems a bit difficult, but maybe they say that about us.
And so there are different, but the beautiful thing about it is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as, say, a coal molecule, and therefore, if they can deal with the problems and these are mainly the radiation, the footprint and the cost, the potential plays, also the effects on the land and other things, almost in a separate league.
If that doesn’t work, what then?
Do we need to take emergency measures to try to keep the earth’s temperature stable?
bg: When you get into this situation, it’s like you’ve eaten too much, and you’re on the verge of a heart attack. what do you do then? you might need a heart surgery or something like that.
There is a research direction called geoengineering, which deals with different techniques to delay the warming so that we will struggle 20 or 30 years longer to call us together.
This is just an insurance method.
Hopefully we don’t need it.
Some people say you shouldn’t just work on insurance because it may make you faulty, so you should keep eating because you know that it will save you from a heart surgery.
I don’t know if it’s wise to bear in mind the importance of this problem, but there is now a discourse in geoengineering about whether it should be available if things come faster, or this innovation takes longer than we expect.
Climate skeptic: Do you have one or two sentences for that to convince you?
BG: Well, unfortunately, those skeptics live in very different camps.
Those who make scientific arguments are very few.
Do they say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things?
There are very, very few things you can say at all, of which there is one chance in a million.
The main problem here is similar to that of AIDS.
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it much later.
And so the idea, now, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, is to invest in something that you only later knew – and therefore the investment is not so clear. in fact, the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say, okay, that’s not a big drama.
The fact is that this uncertainty should worry us.
But my dream here is that if you can do it economically, and at the same time eliminate the CO2, then the skeptics also say: &quot;Okay, it doesn't matter to me that it doesn't emit CO2, I would like it to be the tightest, but I will probably accept it, because it's cheaper than the previous method. &quot;
And that would be their answer to the Bear Lomborg argument that if you spend all that time and energy solving the CO2 problem, all the other goals suffer, which is poverty reduction, the fight against malaria, and so on, that it is a stupid waste of resources, money to invest in it, while there are better things we can do.
bg: Well, the actual spending for the research — let’s say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion per year more than they do today — that’s not so dramatic.
Other things should not suffer.
Then you come to large amounts of money, and here reasonable people can disagree when you have something that is not economic, and try to finance it.
Unless you are very close to a cost breakdown and only funding the learning curve. I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper.
If the abstraction you get is a very high energy price, then only the rich can keep up with it.
I mean, each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifestyle.
But for the bottom two billion, it’s a disaster.
And even Lamborghini thinks of it.
His new mask is now: &quot;Why is the research not discussed anymore? &quot;;
He is still, due to his previous stories, associated with the skeptic camp, but he has understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he now brings the research argument.
And this is a course of thought that I consider appropriate.
It’s just crazy, how little support is given.
Bill, I think I speak for almost all people here, when I say, I really hope that your wish will come true.
BG: Thank you very much.
A few years ago, here at Ted, Peter Skillman presented a design competition named "The Marshmallow Challenge".
The idea is quite simple. four-team teams must build the largest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti, approximately 1m of tape, approximately 1m of faden and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow must be drafted on top.
And, although it sounds really simple, it’s actually really hard because it pushes people to work together very quickly.
So I thought this was an interesting idea and I turned it into a design workshop.
It was a huge success.
Since then, I have conducted about 70 workshops worldwide, with students, developers and architects, even with ctos of the Fortune 50 companies and there is something about this task, which allows for deep impressions in the nature of the collaboration and I would like to share some of them with you.
Usually, most people start to orient themselves regardless of the task.
They talk about it, they think about what it will look like, they rangeln um macht,
Then invest a little time in planning and organizing, they sketch and lay out spaghetti.
They invest a large part of their time in the assembly of constantly growing structures.
And finally, shortly before they have no more time, someone takes the marshmallow and they gently put it on the tip, step back a step and &quot;ta-da &quot;! admire their work.
But what then, almost always, has happened is that the &quot;ta-da&quot; becomes a &quot;uh-oh&quot; because the weight of the marshmallows causes the whole thing to bend and collapse.
There are a number of people who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others, and among the worst are fresh bwl graduates.
They lie, they cheat, they are confused, and they produce really weak educations.
And of course, there are also teams that have much more "ta-da" training and among the best are fresh kindergarten graduates.
And that is quite astonishing.
As Peter told us, they produce not only the highest tower, but also the most interesting structures of all.
What they may be asking is: how did this come about? why? what about them?
And Peter tells us: &quot;None of the children invested time in being a chef of spaghetti gmbh&quot;.
They do not invest time in power struggles.
But there is another reason.
In other words, that bwl students were trained to find the right plan, ok!
and then realize it.
What then happens when you pack the marshmallow on the tip, you don’t have time anymore and what happens?
It is a crisis.
It sounds confident, right?
What kindergarten children do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes, successful prototypes, always with the marshmallow at the top, so that they multiple times have the opportunity to repair accidental prototypes.
The designers recognize this art of collaboration as the core of an iterative advance.
And with every attempt, the children get immediate feedback on what worked and what didn’t.
So the performance of working with prototypes is essential – but let’s see how different teams act.
The average for most is about 50cm, bwl students make half of that, lawyers a little more, but not much, kindergarten children are better than adults.
Who is the most successful?
architects and engineers, fortunately.
1m is the highest I’ve ever seen.
Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures.
CEOs lie slightly above average, but here it will be interesting.
If you put an executive administrator on the team, you will get significantly better.
They look around and realize &quot;this team will win. &quot;
You can predict it, why does it happen?
Because they have special skills of process monitoring.
You lead the process, you understand it.
And the team that regulates and takes care of the work will significantly improve the performance of the team.
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success.
If you have 10 teams that typically progress, you get about 6 that have stable structures.
I am trying something exciting.
I thought, let’s get that poker bet right away.
So I bot a $10,000 prize an software for the winner.
What do you think happened to this design student?
Was that the result?
No team had a stable structure.
If somebody had built a 2.5cm-high structure, it would have taken the price by house.
So is it not interesting that high stakes have a strong effect?
We repeat this exercise with the same students.
What do you think has happened now?
Now they understood the advantage of &quot;prototyping &quot; .
So from the same, bad team one among the best.
They produced the highest construction in the shortest time.
There are therefore profound lessons for us, about the nature of drive and success.
They may ask: why would anyone actually spend time creating a marshmallow challenge?
Therefore, I help create digital tools and processes to help teams create cars, video games and visual effects.
And what the marshmallow challenge tut is, it helps you identify hidden assumptions.
Because frankly, every project has its own marshmallow.
The challenge offers a common experience, a common language or basic attitude to build the right prototype.
And this is the value of this experience, this simple habit.
And those of you who are interested in it can visit marshmallowchallenge.com.
It’s a blog where you can see how the marshmallows are baut.
There is a step-by-step guide there.
You can find crazy examples from all over the world of how people optimize and refine the system.
There are also world records.
And the basic lesson, I believe, is that construction is actually a connective sport.
It requires that we all focus our minds on the task and that we use our minds optimally, like our feelings and our actions, in the challenge that lies before us.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes to bring us from a “uh-oh” to a “ta-da” moment.
And that can make a big difference.
Many thanks.
We act as if we had a machine here.
A great machine, a cool, ted-like machine, and that’s a time machine.
Everyone in this room has to go in.
And they can go to the past, they can go to the future; they cannot stay in the here and now.
And I wonder what they would choose, because I have often asked my friends this question lately, and they all wanted to go back into the past.
They wanted to go back to that time, before there were cars or Twitter or &quot;America seeking the superstar &quot;.
I do not know.
I am convinced that one is somehow attracted to nostalgia, to wunschdenken.
And I understand that.
I am not part of this group, I must say.
I don’t want to go into the past, not because I’m an adventurer.
It’s because opportunities on this planet don’t go backwards, they go forward.
I also want to go into this machine, and I want to go into the future.
This is the greatest time that has ever existed on this planet, no matter what scale they set up: health, wealth, mobility, opportunities, decreasing disease rates.
There has never been a time like this before.
My great-grandparents all died when they were 60.
My grandparents pushed this number to 70.
My parents are the 80 on the fersen.
Therefore, it would be better to have a nine at the beginning of my todeszahl.
But it’s not even about people like us, because this is a bigger thing than that.
A child born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world lived 100 years ago.
Think about it, that’s an incredible tatsache.
And why is it so?
These pockets have killed billions of people on this planet.
They have redesigned the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done.
They are gone, they are gone.
We have forced you down. puff.
In the rich world, there are diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago, hardly yet.
diphtheria, röteln, kinderlähmung ...
Does anyone know what this is?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are the achievements of the scientific method.
And from my point of view, the scientific method of trying things out, to see if it works, to change it if it doesn’t, is one of the greatest achievements of mankind.
So that’s the good news.
Unfortunately, that is all the good news, because there are a few other problems, and they have been mentioned frequently.
And one of them is that despite all our achievements, a billion people on this planet go hungry to bed every day.
This number is rising, and it is rising very quickly, and that is shameful.
And not only that, we have used our imagination to thoroughly destroy this world.
drinkwasser, urbares land, regenwälder, oil, gas: they disappear soon, and if we do not fall out of this chaos-innovate we also disappear.
The question is, can we do that? I think.
I believe it is clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the land they live on.
I think we can supply this world with energy that does not simultaneously destroy it.
I really believe that, and no, that’s not a wunschdenken.
But that’s what keeps me awake at night – one of the things that keeps me awake at night. we’ve never needed scientific progress as urgently as we do now.
And we have never been able to use it rationally, as we can today.
We are on the threshold of amazing, astonishing events in many fields, and yet I really think that we would have to go back hundreds, 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we have fought progress, where we have jumped over these things more violently, on more fronts than we do now.
The people cover themselves in their beliefs, and so narrow that they cannot be liberated.
Not even the truth will set them free.
And listen, everyone has a right to his own opinion; even a right to his own opinion for progress.
But do you know what you do not have the right to?
They have no right to their own facts, they do not have.
And it took me a while to figure it out.
About a decade ago I wrote an article about impfungen für &quot;the new yorker &quot;, a small article.
And I was amazed to encounter resistance, resistance to what is ultimately the most effective measure in health care in the history of mankind.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I always do, I wrote an article and ran forth.
Soon after, I wrote an article about genetically modified foods.
The same bag, only bigger.
The people were playing crazy.
So I also wrote an article about it, and I couldn’t understand why people thought it would be &quot;frankenfood&quot;, why they believed that molecules in a particular way, rather than in a random way, were pushing around an assault on the realm of nature.
But you know, I do what I do. I wrote the article, I did it.
I mean, I am a journalist,
We tip, we get in, we go out to eat, that’s okay.
But these articles worried me, and I couldn’t figure out why, and eventually I found out.
And that’s because those fanatics who made me crazy weren’t fanatics at all.
They were careful people, educated people, decent people.
They were just like the people in this room.
And that made me so confused...
But then I thought, you know, let us be honest:
We have reached a point where we do not have the same relationship to progress as before.
We talk about it in a blatant way.
We ironically talk about it, with small anführungszeichen darum: &quot;fortschritt &quot;.
Okay, there are reasons for this, and I think we know what the reasons are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there is no reason why this should not be the case.
You can just name a few names and people will understand.
Chernobyl, bhopal, die challenger, vioxx, mass destruction weapons, die us-presidentschaftswahl 2000.
I mean, you know, you can choose your own list.
There are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right about.
Ask questions, ask for evidence, ask for evidence.
Do not take anything as given.
But now it comes: if they get the evidence, they must accept the evidence, and we are not good at it.
And I can say this because we are now living in an epidemic of fear, such as I have never seen before and hopefully will never see again.
About 12 years ago, a story was published, a terrible story, that connected the autism epidemic with the masern, mumps, and röteln vaccine.
Very frightening.
Several studies have been conducted to see if this was true.
A lot of studies should be carried out; this is a serious matter.
The dates came in.
The dates came here from the U.S., England, Sweden, Canada, and they were all the same, no correlation, no connection, no one at all.
It makes no difference, because we believe an anecdote, we believe what we see, what we see, what we believe to see, what makes us really feel.
We don’t believe a bunch of documents from a government employee who gives us data, and I understand that, I think we all do.
But do you know what?
The outcome was catastrophic.
Disastrous because of this fact: the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the rate of measles is falling.
This is scandalous and we should be ashamed.
It is horrible.
What happened that we were able to do this.
Well, I understand that. – That’s what I do.
Does anyone have Masern here?
Has a single person in the audience seen someone dying in Masern?
It doesn’t happen very often.
It did not happen in this country at all, but 160,000 times in the world in the past year.
That’s a lot of dead by masern, 20 per hour.
But because that didn’t happen here, we can overthrow it, and people like Jenny McCarthy can run around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King live.
And they can do that because they do not link cause and correlation.
They do not understand that these things seem to be the same, but they are almost never the same.
And that’s something we need to learn, and very quickly.
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He has freed us from one of the worst cravings of mankind.
No fear, no qualen, kinderlähmung, puff, disappeared.
The guy in there is not so much.
His name is Paul Offit.
He has just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people.
This can save the lives of 400, 500,000 children per year in developing countries.
Really good, right?
Well, that’s good, except that Paul runs around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are, and that people should just stop complaining.
And that says it is actually so.
Paul is also a terrorist.
When Paul speaks in a public hearing, he cannot make a statement without an armed guard.
He gets a call home because the people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school.
Because Paul made a vaccine.
I don’t need to say that, but vaccines are unnecessary.
If you take them hard, those diseases return, terrible diseases, and that’s just happening.
We now have masern in this country.
And it will get worse, and pretty soon children will die of it again, because that’s just a matter of numbers.
And they won’t just die of masern.
What about child paralysis? let's take it. why not?
A friend of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago and said she thinks I’m a bit too shrill.
No one has said that before.
She would not vaccinate her child against child paralysis in any case.
Fein is.
Because we don’t have child paralysis. and you know what?
We didn’t have any childhood in this country yesterday.
Today, I don’t know, maybe this morning someone in Lagos boarded an airplane and is just flying to Los Angeles, in the moment is over Ohio.
And in a few hours he landed there and rented a car, and he came to Long Beach, and he will visit one of those fantastic ted-dinners tonight.
He does not know that he is infected with a paralyzing disease, and we do not know that, because this is how the world works.
This is the planet we live on. don’t act like it isn’t.
We love to cover ourselves in lies, we love that.
Have you taken all of your vitamins this morning?
Echinacea, a small antioxidant that helps you to jump.
I know you did it because half of the Americans do it every day.
They take the stuff, and they take alternative remedies, and it makes no difference how often we find that they are useless.
The data proves this constantly.
She darkened her urine. more do they fast never.
That’s okay, they want to pay $28 billion for dark urine.
I totally agree with you.
dunkler urine. dunkler urine.
Why do we do it? why do we do it?
Well, I believe, I understand – we hate the pharmaceutical industry.
We hate a too strong government; we have no confidence in the system.
And we shouldn’t.Our health system is man.
It is cruel to millions of people.
It is absolutely astonishingly cold and soelentötend even to us who can afford it.
So we run away from it, and where are we going?
We are running in the arms of the placebo industry.
I love the placebo industry.
But you know, this is really a serious matter, because the stuff is fog, and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all kinds of small requirements here.
None of them – gingko, scam, echinacea, scam, acai, I don’t even know what it is, but we spend billions of dollars on it, it’s scam.
When I say this, the people shout at me and say, “What do you care?
So you feel good. &quot;
And you know what? they are wrong.
Because I don’t care whether it’s the health minister who says, “Hmm, I’m not going to accept the evidence of my experts on mammography, or any crab-quacksalber who will treat his patients with coffee-inlets.
When they go on this path, where faith and magic replace evidence and science, they arrive in a place where they do not want to be.
They arrived at thabo mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insists that beets, peanut butter and citronene oil are much more effective than antiretroviral medicines, of which we know they can slow the course of AIDS.
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is plagued by this disease worse than any other.
Please do not tell me that these things have no consequences.
They always have them, they always have them.
Now, the most brainless epidemic we are currently experiencing is this absurd struggle between the advocates of genetically modified foods and the bio-elite.
This is an idiotic debate; it has to stop.
It’s a debate about words, about metapherns.
This is ideology, not science.
Everything we eat, every grain of rice, every branch of peterson, every rosenkohl, has been changed by the human being.
You know, there were no mandarines in paradise.
There was no cantaloupe-melon.
There were no Christmas trees; we did it all.
We have done this in the last 11,000 years.
Some of them worked and some did not.
We got rid of what didn’t work.
Now we can do it more precisely. and of course there are risks. but we can do something like vitamin A in reis, and that substance can help millions of people, millions of people, to extend their lives.
Don’t you want to do that?
I have to say, I don’t understand that.
We are genetically modified.
Why do we do this?
Now, what I’m constantly hearing is: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture, we don’t want a huge fieldder with a bag, that’s false.
We don’t want companies to patent life.
We do not want companies to own together.
And you know what my answer to all this is?
You are right, we’ll fix it.
It’s true, we have a huge food problem, but that’s not science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It is right, moral, patent liability.
They know that science is not a company.
It is not a country.
It is not even an idea; it is a process.
It is a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes not, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its work because we are afraid is a real sackgasse, and it keeps millions of people from flourishing.
You know, in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than in the present 70 percent.
this investment in Africa in the last 30 years.
Shameful, shameful and shameful.
You need it, and we don’t give it to you.
Genetically modified food.
We do not want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff, such as the maniac.
Maniac is something that half a billion people eat.
It’s like a potato.
It’s just a bunch of calories, it’s a man.
It has no nutrients, it has no protein, and scientists are building all that right in it.
And then the people could eat it and would not become blind.
You<unk>’t starve, and you know what?
It would not be at panisse, but it would be nice.
And all I can say about it is: why are we fighting this?
I mean, we ask ourselves: why are we fighting this?
Because we don’t want genes to be shifted here?
It’s not about chemicals, it’s not about genes.
It is not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on greater nutrition, better nutrition, unique nutrition.
It’s not about rice krispies, it’s about keeping people alive, and it’s time to understand what that means.
Do you know what?
If we do not do this, if we continue to do as we have done so far, we blame ourselves for something that we, I think, do not want to blame, high-tech colonialism.
There is no other description for what is happening here.
It’s selfish, it’s ugly, it’s not worthy of us, and we really need to stop it.
After this incredibly funny conversation, they may also want to say, “Do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future?”
I want to do that in any case.
Right now it is in the present, but we have an incredible possibility.
We can set this time machine on whatever we want.
We can move them where we want to, and we will move them where we want.
We need to conduct these conversations, and we need to think about it, but when we get into the time machine and go into the future we will be happy to have done that.
I know we can, and as far as I am concerned, this is something the world needs now.
Thank you thanks.
Thank you thanks.
It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it, unless they regard it as I do, as a deception, which becomes something real if someone believes in it firmly enough.
In other words, sugar pills have shown in some studies a measurable effect, the placebo effect, and only because the person thinks what is happening to him, whether a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management, for example, there is, when the patient only believes firmly enough, a measurable effect in the body, which is called the placebo effect.
A deception becomes something real because someone perceives it so.
In order for us to understand each other, I want to show you an elementary, very simple magic trick.
This is a trick that has been in every magical book for children since at least the 1950s.
I myself read it from the cub scout magic of the pfadfinder in the 1970s.
I will execute it for you and then explain it.
And then I’ll explain why I’m declaring it.
So, see what happened.
The knife that you can examine; my hand that you can examine.
I’ll just keep the knife in my fist.
I push my sleeve back.
And to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out of it, I will simply squeeze my wrist right here.
In this way you can see that at no time is anything moving. as long as I press here, nothing in my sleeve can wander or come out.
And the soul here is very simple.
I will open my hand, and hopefully, when everything goes well, the knife will be held by my mere physical magnetism.
It actually sits so tightly in its place that I can shake it without the knife falling down.
Nothing wanders in my sleeve or comes out, no tricksery. and you can investigate everything.
Ta-da is !
Well, this is a trick that I often teach little children who are interested in spells, because you can learn a lot about cheating if you look closer, although it is a very simple trick to execute.
Probably many of you know this trick here in the room.
It works as follows:
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say that I wrap my wrist in order to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out, and that is a lie.
The reason why I hold my wrist is that it is the true mystery of the illusion.
In the moment I turn my hand away from them so that they can see them from behind, this finger moves here, my sighting finger, simply from there, where it is, in a position where it is so stretched out.
A crazy trick?
Behind there is someone who didn’t have a childhood.
So, he is here. exactly.
And when I turn, the finger changes its position.
And now one could talk about why this is a deception, why one does not perceive that there are only three fingers to see here below: because the mind and the way it processes information does not count them individually, one, two, three, but sees them as a group.
But that’s why it doesn’t really work here now, and then I open my hand.
Of course, it is held there, but not by the magnetism of my body, but by a trick, by my sighting finger, which is now there.
And when I close my hand, the same thing happens when I turn back, this movement hides that the finger moves back again.
I take that hand away, and here is the knife.
You can show this trick to your friends and neighbors. thank you.
What does this have to do with the placebo effect?
A year or so ago, I read a study that really touched me.
I am not a doctor or a researcher, and therefore this was an amazing thing for me.
In fact, it turned out that when you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill, in the form of an aspirin pill, it is simply a round, white pill, which has a certain measurable effect.
But if you change the form in which you administer the placebo, for example, into a smaller pill, and that color blue and stamp a letter on it, it is actually measurably more effective.
And that, although none of them are pharmaceutical ... they are merely sugar pills.
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
That really caused me to flip.
But it turns out that that’s not all.
When capsules are taken, they are even more effective than tablets of any form.
A colored capsule, which is yellow at one end and red at the other, is better than a white capsule.
The dosage also plays a role.
One pill twice a day is not as good as three pills – I can’t remember the exact statistics right now.
But the crucial thing is, ...
The dosage also plays a role.
And the form plays a role.
And if one wants to have the ultimate placebo effect, one has to seize the disadvantage.
A spray with an ineffective one – a few milliliters of an ineffective substance, which is injected into a patient.
This creates a very strong image in the head, which is much stronger than a white pill.
This graphic is really ... I will show you it another time, when we have a projector.
The fact is also that the white pill doesn’t work as well as the blue pill, which doesn’t work as well as a capsule, which doesn’t work as well as the needle.
And none of this has any truly pharmaceutical properties; it is only our belief in it that has a stronger effect on us.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick.
I take something that is obviously a deception, and let it look real.
We know from that study that one must grasp the disadvantage when it is to go to the point.
It is very, very spitz. and I will first sterilize it a little bit.
This is really my flesh. it is not Damian's special gezüchtetes fleisch.
This is not a special effect from Hollywood.
I will now squeeze this needle into my skin and push it through until it comes out again on the other side.
If they get sick - if they easily fall into powerlessness - I have presented this to a couple of friends last night in the hotel room, and to some people I didn't know, and in doing so, a woman has quickly become powerless.
So I suggest that if you get sick quickly, then look away for the next 30 seconds. or, you know what, I will do the first delicate part behind here.
You can see it right away, but you can also look away if you want.
So, it’s so, right here, where my flesh begins, at the bottom of my arms, I’ll just make a small kick.
Does this really make you crazy?
And now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side so out again.
Now we are actually in the same situation that we had at the messertrick.
approximately .
But now you can’t count my finger, right?
So I’ll show them that’s one, two, three, four, five.
Now yes,
I know what people think when they see that.
They say, "Okay, he's<unk> not so stupid and pierces his own skin just to talk to us for a few minutes."
Then I’ll show you it.
How does it look like here? pretty good.
Yes, I know it.
And the people behind them say, “Okay, I haven’t seen it right.”
The people in the neighborhoods are now coming in.
Let me show you it from nearby.
This is not a special effect from Hollywood.
This is my flesh, and I can go around it.
If you get sick, look away, don’t look there.
The people behind it, or those who will see this later on video, will say, "Well, yes, that looks pretty impressive, but if it was real, it would - see you, here is a hole and there, if it was really real, it would bleed."
Okay, let me squeeze out a little blood for you.
Yes, here it is.
I would normally take that downside out now.
I would clean my arm and show them that there are no wounds.
But I think, in this framework here and with the intention of making something real out of a deception, I will just let the nail in there and so leave the stage.
We will meet again a few times in the next few days.
I hope you are already looking forward to it. thank you very much.
Everyone is talking about happiness nowadays.
I have let some people count the number of books that have been published with the title "happiness" in the last five years, and they gave up after about 40 years, and there were many more.
There is an enormous wave of interests and happiness under investigation.
There is a lot of happy coaching.
Everyone would like to make people happier.
But despite all this flute of work, there are several cognitive falls that make it almost impossible to think clearly about happiness.
And my talk today will be mainly about these cognitive falls.
This is true for lay people who think about their own happiness, and it is true for scientists who think about happiness, because it turns out that we are just as confused as anyone else.
The first of these falls is a widerstreben, complexity to admit.
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word, because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is a certain meaning to which we could limit it, but overall it is something that we will have to give up, and we will have to assume the complicated visual view of what well-being is.
The second fall is a confusion of experience and memory: basically it consists between being happy in his life and being happy over his life or happy with his life.
And these are two very different concepts, and they are both thrown together in the idea of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of concentration, and that is the unfortunate fact that we cannot think about a circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its meaning.
I mean, this is a real cognitive failure.
There is simply no way to get it right.
Now I would like to start with an example of someone who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures, who told a story. &#91; undeutlich ... &#93; he said he had heard a symphony, and it was absolutely wonderful music, and at the very end of the recording there was a terrible circling noise.
And then added er hinzu, really quite emotional, that ruined the whole experience.
But it did not have it.
What had ruined it were those memories of that experience.
He had that experience.
He had 20 minutes of great music.
They didn’t count because he was left with a memory; that memory was ruined, and that memory was all he had to preserve.
What this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of ourselves.
There is an experienced self that lives in the present and knows the present, is able to re-experience the past, but basically only has the present.
It is the experience itself that the doctor refers to – they know when the doctor asks: &quot;Does it hurt now if I refer to it here? &quot;
And then there is a reminder self, and the reminder itself is the one that tells and sustains the history of our lives, and it is the one that the doctor addresses by asking the question: &quot;How have they felt lately? &quot;
How was your trip to Albania? &quot; or something similar.
These are two very different units, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and to confuse the two is part of the confusion of the concept of happiness.
Now, the reminder itself is a storyteller.
And it really starts with a basic reaction to our memories – it starts immediately.
We don’t just tell stories when we try to tell stories.
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we are allowed to keep from our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
There is another study.
These are real patients who are undergoing a painful procedure.
She is no longer painful today, but she was painful when this study was conducted in the 1990s.
They were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds.
Here are two patients, these are their records.
And they will be asked, “Which of the two has suffered the most?”
And that is a very simple question.
His intestinal reflection was longer, and every minute of pain that patient a had had patient b, and more.
But now there is another question: How much did these patients think they were suffering?
And here is a surprise:
And the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the gut reflection than the patient b.
The stories of the intestinal reflections were different, and because a very crucial part of the story is how it ends --
And none of these stories are very grassy or great -- but one of them is this obviously ...
But one of them is much worse than the other.
And the worst was the one where the pain at the very end was at its peak.
How do we know this?
because we asked these people about their intestinal reflection, and also much later: "How bad was the whole thing overall?"
And it was much worse for A than it was for B in the memory.
This is a direct conflict between the person who experiences and the person who remembers himself.
From the perspective of the survivor himself, B had clearly a worse time.
Now, what one could do with a patient, and we have actually conducted clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it works, one could actually reflect the intestinal reflex of a patient by simply leaving the slug inside without shaking too much on him.
This will cause the patient to suffer, but only a little and much less than before.
And if you do this for a few minutes, you have caused the experiencing person to be worse than the patient, and you have caused the remembering person to be much better than the patient, because now you have given the patient a better story about his experience.
What makes a story a story?
This applies to the stories that the memory provides us, and also to the stories that we invent.
What distinguishes a story are umbrüche, significant moments and ends.
The ends are very, very important and in this case the end dominated.
Now, the person who experiences himself lives his life continuously.
There are moments of life, one after the other.
And they ask: What happened to those moments?
And the answer is really simple; they are lost forever.
I mean, most of the moments of our lives – and I have calculated it – you know, the psychological present is considered to be about three seconds long. which means, you know, there are about 600 million of them in a life. in a month there are about 600,000. most of them leave no trace.
Most of them are completely ignored by the reminder itself.
And yet they somehow get the impression that they should count that what happens during these moments of life is our life.
It is the limited resource that we consume while we are in this world.
And how we consume them would seem to be important, but that is not the story that the reminder itself keeps for us.
So we have the remembering oneself and the experiencing oneself, and they are really quite different.
The biggest difference between them is the deal with time.
If you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation.
This does not work at all for the memory itself.
For remembering itself, a two-week vacation is hardly better than a one-week vacation, because no new memories are added.
You have not changed the story.
And in this way time is actually the critical variable, which distinguishes a remembering self from a experiencing self. time has very little influence on this story.
Now, remembering itself does more than remembering and telling stories.
It is actually the one who makes the decisions, because if you have a patient who, say, had two intestinal reflexions at two different surgeons and decides which one to choose, then the one who chooses is the one who has the memory that is less bad and that is the surgeon who will be selected.
The experience itself has no voice in this election.
In fact, we do not choose between experiences; we choose between memories and experiences.
And even when we think of the future, we normally don’t think of our future as experiences.
We think of our future as predicted memories.
And basically, they can see it, they know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and they can think of the remembering self as one, so to speak, which drags the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self does not need.
I have the impression that when we take a vacation that is very often the fall, that is, we take a vacation to the greatest extent in the service of the remembering oneself.
And that’s a bit hard to justify, I think.
I mean, how much do we eat out of our memories?
This is one of the statements given for the dominance of remembering oneself.
And when I think about it, I think of a vacation we took in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I had ever had, and I think about it relatively often in relation to how often I think of other vacations.
And I probably have from my memories of this three-week journey, I would say, about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I had opened the file with the 600 images in it, I would have spent another hour.
Now, that’s three weeks, and that’s a maximum of an hour and a half.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Well, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in it, how little appetite I have for the digestion of memories, but even if they make more of it there is a real question. why do we give memories so much weight in comparison to the weight we give experiences?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment.
If you imagine your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you will be given an amnesty medication so that you will remember nothing.
Would you choose the same vacation?
And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two kinds of self and you have to think about how to resolve that conflict and that is really not obvious at all, because if you think in the sense of time you get an answer, and if you think in the sense of memories you could get a different answer.
Why we choose the vacation we choose is a problem that comes to us with a choice between the two types of self.
Now, these two kinds of self throw up two concepts of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one for ourselves.
So you can ask: how happy is the person who experiences it himself?
And then they would ask: How happy are those moments in the life of the experienced person himself?
And they are all — happiness for a moment is a rather complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measured?
And, by the way, we are now able to get a fairly good idea of the happiness of the experienced person himself over that time.
When you ask about the happiness of remembering yourself, it’s a very different thing.
It’s not about how happy a person lives.
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person reflects on his or her life.
A very different concept.
Anyone who does not distinguish these concepts is the exploration of happiness, and I belong to a multitude of well-being researchers who have long explored happiness in this way.
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and now one is trying to measure the two separately.
The gallup organization has conducted a worldwide survey, in which more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences.
In recent years, we have also begun to learn about the happiness of both species.
And the main lesson we have, I think, learned is that they are really different.
They can know how satisfied someone is with their life, and that doesn’t really teach them much about how happy their life is and vice versa.
In order to give them an impression of the correlation, the correlation is approximately .5.
What this means is that if you met someone and you told them, "Oh, his father is a two-meter man," how much would you know about his size?
Well, you would know a little about its size, but there is a lot of uncertainty.
You have so much uncertainty.
If I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of ten, they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his experienced self.
The correlation is also small.
We know something about what determines the satisfaction of the happiness-self.
We know that money is very important, ambitions are very important.
We know that happiness primarily means being satisfied with people we like, spending time with people we like.
There are other pleasures, but that is dominant.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two kinds of self, you will end up doing very different things.
The conclusion from what I have said here is that we should not really imagine happiness as a substitute for well-being.
It is a completely different concept.
In short, another reason why we can’t think clearly about happiness is that we don’t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live.
So if you ask the simple question, how happy the people in California are, you will not get the correct answer.
When you ask this question, you think that the people in California must be happier if they, say, live in Ohio.
And what happened is that when you think about living in California, you think about the difference between California and other places, and that difference is, say, in the climate.
Now, it turns out that the climate is not very important for the experienced self, and it is not even very important for the thoughtful self, which determines how happy people are.
But now, because the thoughtful oneself is responsible, they can end up — some people could end up moving to California.
And it is so to speak interesting to track what happens to people who move to California in the hope of becoming happier.
Your self-experience will not be happier.
We know that.
They will think that they are happier, because when they think about it they will be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was and they will feel that they have made the right decision.
It is very difficult to think clearly about well-being, and I hope I have given you an impression of how difficult it is.
Thank you thanks.
Thank you, I have a question for you.
Many thanks.
Now, when we spoke by phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this gallup survey.
Is that something you can share with us because you now have a few minutes left?
Daniel Kahneman: Certainly.
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we absolutely did not expect to find.
We found this in terms of the happiness of the person who experienced it himself.
If we look at ourselves, how feelings vary with that income.
And it turns out that under a income of $60,000 per year, for Americans, and this is a very large sample of Americans, about 600,000, but it is a large representative sample, under a income of $600,000 per year.
60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
$60,000 a year is that people are unhappy, and they become more and more unhappy, the poorer they become.
On this we get an absolutely flat line.
I mean, I’ve rarely seen such flat lines.
What happened, it is obvious that money does not bring experience-happiness, but that lack of money<unk> brings misery, and we can measure this misery very, very clearly.
In the minds of others, in the minds of remembering themselves, they get a different story.
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
This does not apply to emotions.
But, in the entire American pursuit, it is about living, freedom, the pursuit of happiness.
If people would take this finding seriously, I mean, it seems to put everything on the head, everything we believe, for example in regards to tax policy and so on.
Is there a chance that a politician, that the country in general would take such a finding seriously and make policy based on it?
DK: You know, I believe that there is recognition for the role of happiness research in politics.
The recognition will be slow in the United States, no question, but in the United Kingdom it is happening right now and in other countries it is happening right now.
People are in the process of recognizing that they should think of happiness when they think of politics.
It will take a while, and people will discuss whether they want to explore experience-happiness or whether they want to explore life-evaluation, so we have to lead this discussion pretty soon.
How one can raise happiness is very different depending on how they think and whether they think of the inner self or whether they think of the experiencing self.
I think that will influence politics in the coming years.
In the United States it is strict to measure the experience-happiness of the population.
I think that will be part of the national statistics in the next decade or two.
Now, it seems to me, this topic will be, or at least should be, the most interesting political debate to pursue over the next few years.
Thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I am Jane McGonigal, I am designing computer games.
I have been developing online games for 10 years now, and my soul for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save it in online games.
I want to convince more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing larger and more tolerant games.
We currently spend 3 billion hours per week playing online games.
Some of them may think: &quot;this is a whole lot of time for games. &quot;
Per<unk> a little too much time, considering how many problems we urgently have to solve in the real world.
But in fact, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, exactly the opposite is true.
Three billion hours a week are not almost enough to solve the world’s most pressing problems.
In fact, I am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we must drastically increase this time.
I have calculated that the required time is 21 billion hours of play time per week.
This may seem somewhat absurd at first, so I repeat it so it can work: if we want to solve problems such as hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts and obesity, I think we must try to play online games for at least 21 billion hours a week until the end of the next decade.
No, I mean it’s really serious.
Why? this picture describes quite accurately why I believe games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano.
He wanted to capture those feelings while playing. so he set up a camera in front of the player.
This is one of the classic phrases when playing.
If you are not a player, you may miss some of the nuances in this picture.
You probably see this sense of urgency, some anxiety, but also extreme concentration, very deep in solving a really difficult problem.
If you also play, you will see some nuances here, which upwardly pulled eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism.
This is a player who is on the verge of a so-called epic victory.
Oh, you know that. ok. fine. so we have some players here.
An epic victory is a result that is so extremely positive that you did not know before that it was possible at all.
It was beyond the imagination.
And when they reach it, they are shocked that they are actually capable of something like that.
This player is on the verge of an epic victory.
And this is what we have to see on the millions of faces of problem solvers around the world when we take on the obstacles of the next century. the face of those who, in the face of all adversities, are on the verge of an epic victory.
Unfortunately, we are more likely to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems.
I refer to it as the 'in leben bin ich schlecht' face. and it's actually my face, see you?
This is me, as I do the &quot;in leben bin ich schlecht &quot; face mache.
This is a graffiti in my former home in Berkeley, California, where in my doctoral thesis I investigated why we are better at play than in real life.
This is a problem that many players have.
We think that in reality we are not as good as we are in play.
And I don’t just mean less successful, even though that’s part of it.
I mean well in the context of motivation, something meaningful to do, inspired to collaborate with each other.
When we are in a game world, I believe that many of us will transform ourselves into our best version, be helpful at any time and immediately, stubbornly trying to solve the problem, as long as necessary, to try it again after the failure.
And in reality, when we fail, when we encounter obstacles, we often feel different.
We feel overwhelmed, we feel defeated, we feel threatened,<unk> depressed, frustrated, or cynical.
We don’t have these feelings when we play games, in games they simply don’t exist.
And that’s what I wanted to investigate as a doctoral student.
Why is it impossible in games to think, you could not simply<unk> everything?
How can we transfer these feelings from the games to reality?
I also look at games like World of Warcraft an, which provides the ideal environment for joint problem-solving.
And I have found some things that make epic siege in online worlds so possible.
So, first, when you enter one of these online games, especially in World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters who are ready to entrust you with a world-renowned mission, and immediately.
But not just a mission, but a mission that fits perfectly to their current level in play, right?
So you can do that.
You never get a task that you can’t solve.
But there is no unemployment in the world of warcraft.
You don’t sit around and turn your thumbs, there’s always something very specific to do.
And there are lots of collaborators.
Wherever they go, hundreds of thousands of people work with them to complete their epic mission.
In real life, we don’t have that easy, this feeling, that with a finger cut, a bunch of employees are ready.
In addition, there is this epic story, this inspiring story, why we are there and what we have to do.
Then we get all this positive feedback.
they have determined from &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; heard or &quot; + 1 intelligence &quot; .
This constant feedback does not exist in real life.
When I leave this stage, I don’t have: + 1 talk and + 1 crazy idea, + 20 crazy idea.
I don’t get that feedback in real life.
So, the problem with cooperative online worlds such as World of Warcraft is that it is so satisfactory to be on the brink of an epic victory at any time that we would rather spend all our time in these game worlds.
They are better than the reality.
To date, all World of Warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving Azeroth’s virtual problems.
This is not necessarily something bad.
It may sound bad.
5.93 million years ago, our first primate ancestors began to walk upright.
The first upright primate as well.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we currently spend playing, it only makes sense when one keeps that time in mind in terms of the magnitude of human development, which is extraordinary.
But it is also appropriate because it turns out that by spending all this time on play, we actually change what we as humans are in the position to do.
We develop into community-thinking, adorable beings.
That’s the truth, I believe it.
Consider this interesting statistic, recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: the average young man of today in a country with a stronger gaming culture spends 10,000 hours playing online games until the age of 21.
So, 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number, for 2 reasons:
First, for children in the U.S., 10.080 hours are the exact total time they spend in school, from 5th grade to high school graduation – if you never miss it.
So here we have a complete parallel education path, where young people learn just as much what it means to be a good player, as anything else they learn in the school.
And maybe some of them have read the new book by Malcolm Gladwell, “Overflieger.”
They also know his theory of success, the theory of success of 10,000 hours.
It is based on the great research of the cognitive sciences that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any topic until the 21st year of life, we will master it.
We will be as good at whatever we do, like the most important people in the world.
So what we have here is a complete generation of junger menchen, who are master-players.
The big question is also: &quot;what exactly are players masterfully good? &quot;;
For if we could find out this, we would have almost never been there before human potential available.
There are so many people currently in the world who spend at least one hour per day playing online games.
500 million people who are exceptionally good at &quot;something &quot; are.
And in the next decade we will have another billion players, who are exceptionally good at whatever.
If you haven’t heard it yet,
The gaming industry is developing consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks, instead of the broadband internet, so that players around the world, especially in India, China, Brazil, can play online.
An additional billion players are expected in the next decade.
That means we have a total of 1.5 billion players.
So I began to think about what it is that makes us master these games.
Here are the four things I found first: urgency-optimism.
Think of it as extreme self-motivation.
Urgent optimism is the desire to do something immediately, a hurdle to overcome, along with the belief that we have a justified hope for success.
Players always believe that an epic victory is possible, and that it is always worth trying, and at the same time.
Players don’t sit here.
Players are masters in spinning social networks.
There are many more interesting studies that show that we like people more after playing with them, even if they have defeated us badly.
The reason for this is that it requires a lot of confidence to play a game with someone.
We trust that someone will spend time with us, that the rules will be observed, that we have the same soul and that we will stay with it until the end of the game.
Also, playing together enables the growth of bonds, trust and interconnection.
As a result, we build stronger social relationships.
Happy productivity . fantastic !
You know, there is a reason why the average warcraft player plays 22 hours a week, sozusagen as a part-time job.
The reason is that when we play, we are actually happier working hard than when we relax or do nothing.
We know that as human beings we will function optimally when we do hard, meaningful work.
And players are always ready to work hard if they get the right task.
And finally, epic significance.
Players love it, participate in ehrfurcht territories to become planetary dimensional missions.
You probably know all of Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 entries, is the world of warcraft wiki.
Five million people use it for one month.
They have collected more information about World of Warcraft in the Internet than about any other topic in any other wiki in the world.
They create an epic story.
They create an epic wave of knowledge about the world of Warcraft.
Ok, these are also four superpowers, which lead to a single outcome. players are super-powerful, hopeful individuals.
They are people who believe that as individuals they can change the world.
And the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds, but not the real world.
That’s the problem I’m trying to solve.
Edward Castronova is a popular scientist.
His work is brilliant. is investigated why people spend so much time, energy and money in online worlds.
And he says: “We will witness no less than a mass migration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments.”
And that’s from an economist, so it’s logical.
And he said...
Not like me... I develop games, I’m a bit overwänglich.
So, it is said, that actually gives sense, because players can<unk> more in online worlds than in real life.
They can build stronger social bonds in games than in real life. they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life.
So, it is currently quite logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world.
I agree with you, that is logical.
But it is definitely not an optimalsituation.
We have to start turning the real world into a game.
My inspiration comes from an event that took place 2,500 years ago.
There is this ancient wreath, from schafsknöcheln.
Before this fantastic controller there was a schafsknöchel.
These were the first human-developed toy devices.
And if you are familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, you may know this story, the history of how and why games were invented.
According to Herodotus, spiele, genauer würfelspiele, were invented in the Kingdom of Lydia during a famine.
It is said that there was such a great famine that the King of Lydia decided to take on a crazy idea.
The people struggled, the people struggled.
It was an extreme situation; an extreme solution was needed.
So, according to Herodotus, they invented the bowling game and agreed on a national strategy. on one day you would eat. on the next day you would play.
And they would be so deeply immersed in the game, because the games are so fascinating and surround us with more satisfying, happier productivity, that they would forget that there was nothing to eat.
And then, the next day you would play, and the next day you would eat.
And according to Herodotus, they survived this famine for 18 years by eating one day and playing the next.
Likewise, I think, we’re putting games in today.
We use games to escape the suffering of the real world.
We use games to escape everything that doesn’t work in the real world, everything that isn’t satisfying in real life, and we get what we need from the games.
But that doesn’t have to be the end.
That is the exciting thing.
According to Herodotus, after eighteen years, the famine did not get better. so the king decided to set up a last bowling game.
They divided the kingdom in two.
They played a bowling game and the winners were allowed to embark on an epic adventure.
They left Lydia and set out in search of a new homeland; they left just as many people as there was food to survive, and sought with the rest a place where they could thrive.
That sounds crazy, isn’t it?
But recent DNA evidence shows that the Etrusks, who later formed the Roman Empire, have the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.
This is why scientists recently came to the conclusion that Herodotus’ crazy history is actually true.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted almost 20 years, which could explain the famine.
So this crazy story could be voiced.
Per<unk> they actually saved their people by playing, by escaping in games for 18 years and then invading them and learning so much about playing with each other that they saved the entire civilization.
So, we can do that too.
We’ve been playing Warcraft since 1994.
This was the first real-time strategy game of the World of Warcraft series.
We’ve been playing warcraft for 18 years, and we’ve been playing warcraft for 16 years.
I assert, we are ready for our own epic game.
So, they sent half of their civilization in search of a new world. so I take my 21 billion gaming hours per week.
We should agree that half of us spend one hour per day playing games until we have solved the real-world problems.
I know, they will ask: &quot;How do we solve the problems of the real world in games? &quot; and this is precisely the question I have devoted my work in the last few years at the Institute for the Future.
We have this banner in our office in palo alto, it expresses how we should understand the future.
We do not want to try to predict the future in advance.
What we want is to create the future.
We want to imagine the best possible outcome and then empower people to put that idea into reality.
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunities to<unk> them.
I will briefly show you three games that I have designed to try to bring mankind an epic victory in their own future.
This is &quot;a world without oil. &quot;
The game is from 2007.
It is an online game in which you have to overcome a landslide.
The country’s scarcity is invented, but we have enough online content so that it becomes realistic for you and you can actually live your real life without oil. so when you sign up for the game, tell us where you live. and then you get real-time news films that show you how much oil costs, what is not there, how food supply is impaired, how transportation is impaired, whether schools are closed, whether there are riots. and you need to figure out how to shape your real life, if it were true. and we will ask you to blog, video or photos about it.
We tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we have been accompanying them over the past three years.
And I can tell you, it was a changing experience.
No one wants to change their lives because it’s good for the environment or because we should.
but when they are in an epic adventure and they are told: "Our oil goes out."
This is a fascinating adventure that one goes on.
Most of our players have the habits learned in the game.
So, for the next world-threatening game, we have a larger, higher soul aside from only landslide.
We have developed the game &quot;superstruct &quot; am institute for the future.
The starting point is the calculation by a supercomputer that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
This supercomputer is called &quot;global extinction-sensitization-system &quot;, of course.
On the call to a player, to sign up, we’ve made a fast like a ‘Jerry-Bruckheimer’ movie.
They have the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-sträfling and only together can they save the world.
But in our game, instead of just five people, we say, everyone is in the dream team, and it is our task to create the future for energy, food, health, security and the future of social justice.
8,000 players played the game for 8 weeks.
They will find 500 incredibly creative solutions, which you can read when you &quot;superstruct &quot;Google.
And the last game we’ll release on March 3, it’s a game in collaboration with the World Bank.
When they complete the game, they will be awarded by the weltbank the award &quot;socialer umgestalter &quot;, graduate 2010.
We work with universities across Black Africa and invite them to learn, social transformation.
We have a high level &quot;for regional understanding, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and ingenuity.
I would like to invite you all to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, especially in development areas, who benefit from joining their own social enterprises to save the world.
I come to the end.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think will happen next?
We have all these fantastic players, we have games that show us what we can do, but we haven’t saved the real world yet.
Well, I hope you agree with me that gamers are human resources that we can use to work in real life, and that games have a great significance for change.
We have all these superpowers, happy productivity, the ability to tie tight social networks, urgency optimism, and the desire for more epic meaning.
I really hope that we can play significant games together to survive another century on this planet.
And I hope that you will design and play with me such games.
When I look forward to the next decade, I am sure of two things: that we can create any imaginable future, and that we can play all kinds of games.
So I say, let the world-changing games start!
Thanksgiving .
I would like to tell you something that I noticed a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian wired.
I always have my synonym-wörterbuch griffbereit when I write, but I was already done with the editing of texts, and I noticed that I have never in my life pursued what the word "hindered" really means.
I’ll read the record for you.
&quot; behindert &quot;, adjectives: &quot;verkrüppelt, hilflos, nutzlos, zerstört, abgestorben, stümmelt, woundet, zugerichtet, lahm, abgetrennt verwahrlost, ausgedient, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, gehandicapt senil, altersschwach, out of the traffic gezogen, nachgebessert, erledigt, kaputt geborsten, counted, see also injured, nutzlos und schwach.
antonyme : healthy , strong , efficient . &quot;
I read this list out loud to a friend and had to laugh at first, it seemed so ridiculous, but I only came by and could not talk further, and had to stop reading and first pick up after this overwhelming wortflut and the associated emotional shock.
Of course, this was an outranstes, altes synonym-wörterbuch. i have just thought that the issue must already be pretty old.
But in fact it was an issue in the early 80s, when I just started in elementary school and started building and shaping my self-image outside my family environment, also in relation to other children and to the rest of the world around me.
And thank God, I did not use a synonym-wörterbuch at the time.
If I were to take this record seriously, I would have been born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life can in no way be positive.
So I immediately searched the 2009 online edition and look forward to finding a more relevant post here.
Here is the updated version of this entry.
Stupidly, she’s not much better.
In particular, the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; &quot; ganz &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; shook me.
But it’s not just about the words.
It’s about what we think about the people we describe with these words.
It is about the values contained in these words, and how we construct those values.
Our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us.
Many ancient societies, including those of the Greeks and Romans, have truly believed that the pronunciation of a curse has a great power, because what is spoken out loud can also manifest itself.
So what do we really want to manifest – a handicapped person or a powerful person?
To describe a careless person as a child alone could be enough to restrict them and overwhelm them with ideas.
Wouldn’t it be better to open the doors to them?
A man who opened the doors for me was my child doctor at a.i. dupont institute in wilmington in delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian-American whose name, as you can imagine, most Americans could not correctly pronounce.
and dr. p. trug always very colourful flies and was for that work with children as simple as created.
I found that the time I spent in this hospital was just a toll – except for my physiotherapy.
I had to repeat individual exercises seemingly infinitely often with these thick, elastic strips – in different colors – that they know, in order to build my leg muscles . and I hated these strips more than anything else . I hated them . I have cursed them . I have hated them .
And imagine, I even negotiated with Dr. P. as a five-year-old child and so tried to stop these exercises, naturally without success.
And one day he watched me at one of my exercises—these exercises were simply exhausting and merciless—and he said to me, “Wow, aimee, you are such a strong, powerful and young girl, you will one day tear down one of these bands.
And if you succeed, I will give you a hundred dollars. &quot;
This was, of course, just a simple trick by Dr. P. so that I could do the exercises I didn’t want to do with the prospect of becoming the wealthiest five-year-old girl in the hospital station in the second stock. but he actually caused me to see my daily exercise horror with new eyes.
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my self-image and I could imagine myself as a strong, powerful and athletic human being by nature.
This is just one example of many, how adults in power positions can stimulate a child’s imagination.
But as the aforementioned examples from the synonym-wörterbüchern prove, our language leaves no room for us to imagine something that we all would like: enabling each individual to see themselves as powerful people.
Our language hints behind the social changes, which in many cases were triggered by a technological shift.
From a medical point of view, of course, it can be said that my legs, laser surgery for sight disabilities, titan knee joints and artificial hip joints for aging bodies, which allow people to really use all their possibilities and develop beyond the limits set by their natural destiny, not to mention social networking platforms, allow people to give themselves their own identity, to define themselves in their own way, and thus to globally orient themselves to groups that they choose themselves.
Per<unk> this technological change makes it clearer than ever that there has always been another truth, namely that every human being can give society something very special and very powerful, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest plus.
The human ability to adapt – this is an interesting story, because people are repeatedly asking me to tell how I deal with adversities and I will confess something to them: this phrase has never suited me and I have always felt very uncomfortable answering people’s questions about it, and I think, gradually, I understand why.
This phrase of dealing with adversities lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on mastering a challenge without being shaped by the experience associated with it . as if my life had been so successful because I could avoid the possible fall of a life with a prosthetic, or whatever people perceive me with my disability.
Of course, we are characterized by the challenge, whether it is physical, emotional, or even both.
And I assert that this is good.
Disadvantages are not obstacles that we need to curve around in order to better understand our lives.
Disadvantages simply belong to our lives.
And I tend to see adversities as my shadow.
Sometimes I notice that he is very present, sometimes he is hardly visible, but he is always with me.
And I do not want to underestimate the impact or the severity of a man’s struggle.
There are adversities and challenges in life, and they are only all too real and each person deals with them differently. but the question is not whether we get clear with adversities or not, but how we get clear with them.
We are therefore not only responsible for protecting the people we love from fate, but also for preparing them to get out of it well.
And we don’t do our child a favor if we make them feel that they can’t adapt.
Two things must be clearly separated: on the one hand, the medical fact of being amputated and, on the other hand, the social opinion about whether I am disabled or not.
And to be honest, the only real and lasting obstacle that I had to deal with is that the world is constantly thinking that it can describe me with these definitions.
In our desire to protect those people we care about and to tell them the cold, harsh truth about their medical prognosis, or even to make a forecast on the quality of life that awaits them, we must be careful that we do not lay the foundation that someone is actually disabled.
Per<unk> the current concept, which focuses only on what is in a breakdown, and how to fix it, is a greater handicap for each individual than the pathology itself.
If we do not treat a person holistically, and do not perceive and recognize all of his powers and possibilities, we create, in addition to the natural struggle they may have to carry out, another disease.
We are degrading a person who has value for our society.
So we need to look beyond the pathology and focus on all areas of human possibilities.
But most importantly, there is a connection between the perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit.
We should not underestimate or deny these challenging times, we should not try to avoid them, nor should we turn them under the carpet, but it is about recognizing opportunities in the adversities.
Per<unk> it’s more about me to make it clear that we don’t necessarily have to overcome adversities, but that we are open to embracing them, packing them in order to even use a struggle expression and maybe even dancing with them.
And<unk> we manage to see adversities as something natural, sound and useful and feel so that we are no longer so burdened by their presence.
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin and as he wrote about evolution 150 years ago, Darwin, in my eyes, pointed to something very true in the human character.
I would describe it as follows: it is not the strongest of its kind that survives, nor the most intelligent of its kind, but the one who can best adapt to change.
Conflict leads to creativity.
Not only from Darwin’s work, we know that man’s ability to survive and flourish is determined by the struggle of the human mind to wander through conflicts.
So, again, change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man.
And<unk> we only know from what wood we are carved when we are really tested.
Per<unk> that is precisely the sense of adversities, a perception of the I, a feeling for our own power.
We can give ourselves something like that.
We can give difficulties a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times.
Per<unk> we can see adversities as a change.
Adversities represent a change to which we have not yet adapted.
I believe that the greatest harm we have inflicted on ourselves is to believe that we should be normal.
Mal ehrlich – who is normal?
There is no normal.
There is the usual, the typical, but not the normal, and would you really want to know this poor, grey person if they really exist?
I think, rather not.
It would be great if we could exchange this pattern of normality for another of possibilities or strengths, in order to formulate it even a little more dangerously. so we can free up the forces of very many children, and invite them to bring their very special and valuable abilities into society.
Anthropologists have discovered that we humans have always demanded one thing from members of our society: to be useful and to contribute.
There are indications that even the Neanderthals 60,000 years ago carried older people and people with severe physical injuries, and this may have happened because the life experience in the survival struggle of these people for society was valuable:
They did not regard these people as broken and useless; they were treated as something special and valuable.
A few years ago I went to a food market in the town where I was raised in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, and I stood there in front of a shelf of tomatoes.
It was summer and I was wearing shorts.
And I hear a guy behind me say, “Well, if that’s not Aimee Mullins.”
I turned around and saw this elderly man; I had no idea who he was.
And I meant "sorry, sir, we know each other?" and I can't remember her.
And he said, “Well, they will hardly remember me.
When I saw her for the first time, I took her out of her mother’s belly.
Oh so there.
And of course, it made a click.
That was Dr. Kean, a man I only knew from my mother’s stories about this tag, because of course, quite typically, I arrived two weeks late on my birthday.
My mother's doctor for prenatal diagnostics was on leave, so my parents didn't know the man who brought me to the world at all.
And because I was born without wadenbeine, and my feet had turned to them, and I only had a few zehen on this one and a few zehen on the other foot was the transmitter, this stranger had to convey the bad news.
He said to me, “I had to tell your parents that you<unk>’t run, that you<unk>’t be as moving as other children, or that you<unk>’t be able to live an independent life, and since then they have just lied to me.”
I found it truly exceptional that he has collected newspaper releases from my whole childhood, regardless of whether I had won a bookmaker competition in the second grade, whether I was on the road with the pfadfindern at the parade to Halloween, whether I had won my scholarship or one of my sports sieges, and he used these releases to teach his students, medical students from the hahnemann medical school and the hershey medical school.
He called this part of his course the X factor, the potential of the human will.
It is simply not possible to emphasize enough how decisive this factor can be for a person’s quality of life.
Dr. Kean continued, he said: "I have learned that if children are not constantly told something different, and even if they are only given a little support, if you leave children on their own, then children can<unk> a lot.
See, Dr. Kean has changed his mind.
He had understood that the medical diagnosis, and how someone deals with it, are two different things.
And I also changed my mind over time, if they had asked me at the age of 15 years if I had changed my prosthetics for bones of meat and bones, I would not have hesitated for a second.
I wanted to look normal at the time.
If you ask me this today, I’m not so sure.
And it happened because I experienced something with my legs and not despite those experiences.
And<unk> this shift could also happen because I have encountered so many people who have opened doors to me, instead of encountering people who would restrict me or try to overthrow my imagination.
You see, you really need only one person to show you how you can manifest your powers, and you are through.
If you allow someone to activate their own inner forces – the human mind is so receptive – if you do that, and open a kind for someone at a crucial moment, then you are a very good teacher for those people.
They teach them to open their doors for themselves.
the actual meaning of the words &quot;educate &quot;roots in the word &quot;educate &quot; .
It means bringing about something that is in one that has the potential to emerge.
Again, what potential do we want to explore now?
In the 1960s, a case study was conducted in Great Britain. then the gymnasiums were converted into entire schools.
They call it the "tracking" &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the U.S. We designate it as &quot;tracking &quot; .
The students are divided by notes.
and those students are tested verbally harder, get the better teachers etc.
They were then given over a three-month-old student with an “sufficient” note that was “very good”; they were told that they were asse, that they were very clever; and after those three months they really wrote one.
And of course, it breaks one’s heart to hear that the reverse has been said to the Einser-student, they are only sufficient.
And it was the same after the three months.
but only those who were still in school – except for the student who had disbanded the school.
It was very crucial in this study that the teachers were not initiated.
The teachers did not realize that something had changed.
They were simply told that they were the one-students and that the students with the note are sufficient . and likewise they taught them something and treated them.
The only real handicap is a broken mind a mind that has been broken, has no hope anymore. he finds nothing more beautiful. he lacks our natural, childish curiosity. and our innate ability of imagination.
But if we manage to support the human mind, to continue to hope, to find ourselves and other people around us beautiful, to be curious and imaginative, then we use our forces really positively.
If a mind possesses these qualities, we can create a new reality and new forms of being.
I would like to end with a poem, written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century, about which my friend Jacques Dembois told me. and the poem is titled "Der Gott, der nur vier Worte kennt". &quot;Every child knows God, not the god of names, not the god of prohibitions, but the god, who only knows four words and repeats them constantly, he always says only: Come, dance with me. &quot;
Come dance with me, thank you very much.
How would you want to be better if you are right now?
Supposedly, I said that, by a few changes to their genes, they could have a better memory – more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or you want to be fitter, stronger, have more power.
Do you want to become more attractive and confident?
How would it be to live longer with good health?
Or maybe you are one of those who have always longed for more creativity.
Which would you like the most?
What would you like to have if you could only have one?
Creativity .
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hands, let me see you.
Probably as many as there are creative people here.
That is very good.
How many would choose for a good memory?
A few more already.
What about fitness?
A few fewer.
What about longevity?
I like to read that, as a doctor.
If you could have only one of them, it would be a completely different world.
Is this all just an illusion?
Or is it possible?
The evolution has been an ongoing topic here at the Ted conference, but today I want to give you the opinion of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay titled “Nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”
Now, if you are one of those who do not accept the evidence of biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aids, take your personal communication device - I give you permission - and maybe you can take a look at Kathryn Schultz's book, which is why it is a mistake, because nothing in the further course of this talk will make any sense for you.
But when they accept biological evolution, think of the following: is it only about the past, or is it also about the future?
Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us too?
This is another look at the tree of life.
In this picture, I have placed a bush as the center of the branches in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, all existing species at the tips of this branch have succeeded in evolutionary terms: they have survived; it has demonstrated its environment fitness and strength.
The human part of this bush, far beyond, is of course what we are most interested in.
We are shifting from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In this Zeitraum, there may have been 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It seems that we are quite distant from the other parts of the tree of life, but in fact, for the most part, the basic mechanisms of our cells are pretty much the same.
Are they aware that we can take advantage of it and require the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin, which is used to treat diabetics?
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically inseparable from those that come from the abdominal speicheldraze.
And while we are already talking about bacteria, are you aware that each of us in our gut has more bacteria than it has cells in the rest of our body?
Maybe 10 times as much.
I mean, think, when Antonio Damasio asks about her self-image, do you think about those bacteria?
Our gut is a wonderful, hospitable environment for these bacteria.
It is warm, it is dark, it is humid, it is very cozy.
And you will provide them with all the nutrients they could only want without any effort on their part.
It is really an easier way for bacteria, with occasional interruptions of the unintended, forced blow to the output.
But otherwise, they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria, just as they are important for their lives.
They help digest essential nutrients and protect them from certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we in an evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species?
Or are we destined to become something else—something that is<unk> even better adapted to the environment?
Let us now go a step back to the time of the urknall 14 billion years ago — the earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years ago — the first signs of living beings,<unk> three to four billion years ago on Earth — the first multi-celled organisms,<unk> as much as 800 or one billion years ago — and then the human species, which finally formed in the last 130,000 years.
In this enormous incomplete symphony of the universe, life on earth is only briefly measured; the animal kingdom, like a single tact; and of human life, a small notenverzierung.
That was us.
This is also the entertainment value of this talk, but so I hope you liked it.
Now, when I was a newbie at college, I had my first biology courses.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I made a very basic note: in most of the existence of life in single organisms, each cell divides, and all the genetic information of the cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time, as multicellular organisms appeared, things began to change.
sexual reproduction tritt in picture .
And very importantly: with the introduction of sexual reproduction, which is passed on by the genome, the rest of the body becomes exhausted.
In fact, one could say that the inevitability of the death of our body in the evolution occurs at the same time as the sexual reproduction.
Now I have to confess, when I was a college student, I thought, okay, sex / tod, sex / tod, tod for sex - it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with each year, it has come to my growing doubts.
I have come to understand the feelings of George Burns, who presented his show in Las Vegas in the 90s.
And one night, there is a knock on his hotel room door.
This type is opened.
In front of him stands a beautiful, sparsely dressed showgirl.
She looks at him and says, “I’m here for super-sex.”
“It’s wonderful,” said George, “I’m going to take the soup.”
I came to the realization as a doctor that I was working on a soul that was different from the soul of evolution – not necessarily contradictory, only different.
I tried to preserve that body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to regain my health after a disease.
I wanted us to live a long and healthy life.
Evolution is all about the transfer of the genome to the next generation, adaptation and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like booster rockets designed to send the genetic cargo to the next stage of the orbit, and then fall into the sea.
I think we would all understand the mood that Woody Allen expressed when he said, “I don’t want to<unk> immortality through my work.”
I will<unk> it by not dying. &quot;
Evolution does not necessarily mean preferring the longest life.
It does not necessarily privilege the biggest, the strongest, or the fastest, and not even the smartest.
Evolution privileges those creatures who adapt best to their environment.
It is the only test of survival and success.
bacteria are present on the bottom of the ocean, which are thermophilic and thus survive the hot steam otherwise, if fish were there, it would have vacuum cooked fish to follow yet they have managed to make a habitable environment there for themselves.
So what does this mean, when we look back at what is happening in evolution, and how we think about the place of human beings in evolution, and especially how we look forward to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evolve.
We have achieved a kind of balance.
And the reasons for this would be that, first of all, through medicine, we have managed to retain a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have configured our environment so that we have managed to adapt to us precisely as we adapt to them.
And by the way, we wander and circulate and mix so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for the evolution to take place.
A second possibility is that it will be an evolution of traditional art, of course, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly melting but they are relentless.
And as far as the isolation goes, if we as species inhabit distant planets, there will be isolation and the changes in the environment that evolution could produce naturally.
But there is a third possibility, a seductive, fascinating and frightening possibility.
I call it neo-evolution – the new development that is not just natural, but guided and decided by us as individuals in the decisions we make.
How could this have happened?
How could it be possible for us to do this?
Let us first consider the reality that people today, in some cultures, make decisions about their offspring.
They are, in some cultures, the ones who voted to have more men than women.
It is not necessarily good for society, but it is what the individual and the family decide.
So they think if it would be possible not only to choose the sex of their child, but also to make genetic adjustments on that body that would cure and prevent diseases.
What if they could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer’s, or to reduce the risk of cancer or stroke?
Wouldn’t they want to make these changes in their genes?
If we look ahead, this kind of change will become increasingly possible.
The human genome project began in 1990 and lasted 13 years.
It cost $2.7 billion.
In the following year, when it was completed in 2004, they were able to do the same thing for $20 million in a period of up to four months.
Today, they can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about $20,000 and within the space of about a week.
It will not be long before the reality is that there will be the $1,000 human genome, and it will be increasingly available to everyone.
A week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded the draper prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stammer, two scientists who independently developed techniques that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and produce desirable proteins in a more efficient way – which Frances Arnold calls direct evolution.
A few years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in where there is an adult hautzelle nahm, a fibroblast, and by manipulating only four genes that the cell induced to attribute it to a pluripotent stem cell - a cell potentially in the lage is to become any cell in your body.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that human insulin produces in bacteria can make viruses that can serve not only as protection against themselves, but also as immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or not, it is an experimental study in progress with a flu vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine anything good that comes from tobacco?
This is all a reality today and much more will be possible in the future.
Then just think of two other small changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells of your offspring?
What if you could change the sperm and eggs or the newly fertilized not to give your child a better chance for a healthier life - eliminating diabetes, eliminating hemophilia, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn’t want healthier children?
And then the analytical technique, the same engine of science that can enable those changes in order to prevent disease, could also allow us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities - the better memory.
Why not have the skill of a Ken Jennings, especially if it can be expanded with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer?
Why not live anymore?
They will be irresistible.
And if we are at a point where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will be transformed from alt-style evolution to neo-evolution.
We will have a process that usually may take 100,000 years, and we can compress it for a thousand years - and maybe even for the next 100 years.
These are decisions that their ankle, or their ankle, must be bypassed.
Do we use these decisions to shape a society that is better, that is more successful, that is more friendly?
Or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others?
Will we have a society that is more homogeneous and uniform, or more robust and versatile?
These are the kinds of questions that we have to face.
And deepest of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and the wisdom of masters that we will need to make these decisions wisely?
Both good and evil, and sooner than they might think, these decisions will lie to us.
Thank you thanks.
I want you to imagine something now, a portable robot that will give you supernatural abilities, or another that will help wheelchairs to get up and walk again.
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletals.
They are nothing but something that they put on in the morning and that gives them extra strength and that will further increase their speed and that will help them to keep, for example, their balance.
In fact, this is the true fusion of man and machine.
But not only that – with it they merge and network with the universe and other devices out there.
This is not just a crazy idea.
To show them now what we are working on, we begin by talking about the American soldier who carries an average of about 100 pounds on his back and there is the request that they should carry more equipment.
Of course, this leads to some significant complications – back injury, 30 percent of which – chronic back injury.
We also thought that we would take on this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this problem.
Let me now introduce you to Hulk – or the human universal load carrier.
Soldier: With the hulc-exoskeleton, I can carry 200 pounds over various types of terrain, many hours long.
Its flexible design allows for deep hocking, crushing and highly agile movements.
It feels what I want to do, where I want to go, and then increases my strength and endurance.
We are so far, with our industry partner, to present this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
It is also true.
Let us now focus our gaze on the wheelchair driver, something for which I am<unk> passionate.
There are 68 million people around the world who are estimated to sit in a wheelchair.
That’s about one percent of the total population.
In fact, this is a conservative estimate.
We often talk here about very young people with backbone injuries, who were hit by fate during the bloom of their lives – 20, 30, 40 – and the wheelchair is the only option.
But it’s also about the ageing population, whose numbers are multiplying.
And so pretty much the only option – when it comes to a stroke, or other complications – is the wheelchair.
And so, by the way, it has been for 500 years, since its, as I must say, very successful introduction.
We also thought that we could start writing an entirely new chapter in the field of mobility.
Let me now introduce you to elegs, worn by Amanda Boxtel, who suffered a backbone injury 19 years ago, which resulted in her being unable to walk for 19 years and until now.
Many thanks.
As I said, Amanda wears our elegs.
It has sensors—
Its completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches, which send signals back to our onboard computer, which is attached here on their back.
Here are also battery packings, the engine drive is located on their hips, as well as on their knee joints, which they move forward in this rather flexible and very natural way of walking.
I was 24 years old and in best form, as a monstrous purzelbaum during a ski break paralyzed me.
In a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and every movement underneath my backs.
Not long after, a doctor walked into my hospital room and said, "Amanda, you will never be able to walk again."
That was 19 years ago.
I have stalled every little hope out of my consciousness.
Adaptable technologies have since made it possible for me to learn, again to ski, climb and even ride a wheel with my hands.
But nothing has been invented that would let me go again, until now.
Many thanks.
As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them.
It is in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations – not just for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all wheelchair drivers, but for all.
Many thanks.
At home in New York, I am the head of the development department of a non-profit organization named Robin Hood.
If I am not fighting poverty, I am fighting as a helper of a firefighting chief in a voluntary fire fight.
Now, in our town, where volunteers support a highly qualified fire department, one has to be at the fireplace quite early in order to be able to mitigate.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer at the fireplace, and I also had a good chance to get in.
But it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the responsible chiefman and find out what our tasks would be.
When I found the chief, he had just had a very serious conversation with the housewife, who<unk> had one of the worst days of her life.
It was midnight and she stood in the sleeping suit and barefoot under a screen outside in the raining rain, while her house stood in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let’s call him Lex Luther — reached the chiefman first and was asked to go into the house and rescue the owner’s dog.
I was sprachlos before them.
There was a lawyer or asset manager who could tell the man for the rest of his life that he was in a burning house trying to save a living creature only because he was five seconds faster than me.
I was the next one.
The chief man nodded to me.
He said, “Bezos, you have to go into the house.
You have to go up, by the fire, and have to hole this woman a pair of shoes.
I swear it.
Now, not exactly what I had hoped, but I went off — the stairs up, the flur along, the "true" firefighters past, who at this time were already pretty much ready with them, in the bedroom to pick up a couple of shoes.
I know what you think now, but I’m not a hero.
I carried my prey back down where I met my enemy and my beloved dog on the doorstep.
We carried our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his attention was considerably greater than mine.
A few weeks later, the fire department received a letter from the homeowner thanking her for the courageous effort to rescue her house.
A kindness that was highly appreciated: someone had even brought her a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin Hood and in my side job as a volunteer firefighter, I am a witness to generosity and kindness on a large scale, but I also see acts of charity and individual courage.
Do you know what I learned?
They are all important.
So when I look at myself in this room and see people who have either already achieved a remarkable success or are on their way there, I would like to offer the following reminder: Do not wait.
Do not wait to make a difference in someone else’s life until you have reached your first million.
If you have something to give, give it now.
serve them in a soup kitchen, clean up a park in the neighborhood,
Be a mentor.
Not every tag will give us a chance to save a person’s life, but every tag offers us the opportunity to change one.
So put it off; save the shoes.
Many thanks.
Bruno guissani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Many thanks.
I have just returned from a community that knows the mystery of mankind’s survival.
It is a place where women do the zepter, say hello with sex, and play the day – where fun is a serious affair.
And no, it’s not Burning Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, your relatives.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the Urwald of Congo.
Bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, our closest living relatives.
This means that we have a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Chimpanzees are known for their aggressiveness.
But unfortunately, we have overemphasized this aspect in the narrative of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees are led by large, frightening guys, the bonobo society is led by empowered females.
They have really figured out something, because this leads to a highly tolerant society, in which lethal violence has not been observed before.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least known among the primates.
They live in the depths of the Congolese Urwald, and are difficult to observe.
The Congo is a paradox – a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the darkness itself – the scene of a violent confrontation that has been furious for decades and has claimed almost as many lives as the First World War.
It is not surprising that this destruction also endangers the survival of the bonobos.
Meat trade and the decline in tree stocks lead to the fact that one could not even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos — and even then we are not sure to be honest.
And yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear a hidden laugh that shakes the trees.
Who are those relatives?
We know them as love instead of war, because they often have bisexual sex, with changing partners, and thus regulate conflicts and social concerns.
I don’t say yes, that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems – because the life of the bonobos consists of more than the soma sutra.
Bonobos – like humans – love to play for a lifetime.
Play is not just children’s games.
For us and her, play is fundamental for the establishment of relationships and the cultivation of tolerance.
In this way, we learn confidence and the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it is primarily about the generation of diversity – diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And if you observe bonobos while playing, you can see the evolutionary origins of human laughter, dances, and rituals.
The game is the kitten that holds us together.
Well, I don't know how they play, but I want to show you some unique recordings straight out of the wild.
First a ball game on bonobo art -- and I don't think about football.
So here we see a young female and male in a pursuit game.
Look at what she does.
This could be the evolutionary origin of: &quot;She packt him by the egg. &quot;
I just think he likes it more, isn’t it?
Yes yes!
Sex games are also widespread, both with bonobos and menchen.
And this video is really interesting, because it shows – and this video is really interesting, because it shows the richness of ideas with which to bring new elements into play – such as the head – and also, how the game both demands and promotes confidence – while at the same time it is immensely fun.
But the game is a formwandler.
The game is a shape change and it can take many forms, some of which are slightly quieter, imaginative, curious—per<unk> in order to re-discover that astonishment.
And I want to show you, that is fuku, a young female, and she plays peacefully with a wasser.
I think, just like them, we sometimes play alone, and we play out the boundaries of our inner and outer worlds.
And it is this playful curiosity that makes us research, and interact, and the unexpected connections that we form are the real feedstock of creativity.
This is just a small tasting of the insight that bonobos give us into our past and present.
But they also keep a secret for our future, a future in which we must adapt to increasing challenges, through greater creativity and increased cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these skills.
In other words, play is our adaptation joker.
In order to successfully adapt to an unstable world, we must play.
But will we make the best out of our game drive?
The game is not albern.
But essentially.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not made up of teeth and teeth alone.
Especially when it hardly seems appropriate, play is<unk> the most necessary.
And so, my primate comrades, let us embrace this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, comradeship and astonishment.
Thank you thanks.
I want you to imagine two couples, not 1979, I am exactly the same tag, in exactly the same moment, each zeugt a baby - okay.
So two pairs, each conceiving a baby.
Now I don’t want you to spend too much time introducing the zeugung, because if you imagine the zeugung all the time, you won’t listen to me.
Imagine this for a moment.
And in this scenario, they imagine that in one case the sperm carries a y chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the sperm carries an X chromosome, which hits the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are capable of survival, both are destroyed.
We will come back to these people later.
In most of my activities, I have two hats on.
Underneath a hut, I engage in the history of anatomy.
I am a student historian, and in this case I am investigating how humans interact with anatomy – i.e. human bodies, animal bodies – how they interact with body fluids, with body concepts; how they have thought about bodies.
The other hood I’ve worn in my work is that of the activist, as a patient’s lawyer – or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient lawyer – of people who are doctors’ patients.
In this case, I have worked with people who have body types that question social norms.
So I have worked with humans, for example, who are Siamese twins, two humans in one body.
I have worked with people with zwergenwuchs – that is, people who were smaller than usual.
And very often I have worked with intersex people whose gender is atypical – that is, people who do not have the average male or female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the word intersexuality.
Intersexuality occurs in many different forms.
I will only give you a few examples of the possible types of gender variants that do not correspond to the male or female standard.
In one case, you may have someone with a xy chromosome base, and the sry gene of the y chromosomes allows the protogonades that we all have at the fetal stage to grow.
This is why the heads in the fetal stage give testosterone ab.
But because this individual lacks the receptors to recognize the testosterone, the body does not react to the testosterone.
This is called androgen receptor defect.
So much testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops more following the typical female course.
When the baby is born, she looks like a girl.
she is a girl. she is grown up as a girl.
But it usually takes until she reaches puberty and her breasts grow and develop, but she does not get her period until someone realizes that there is something different here.
And they do a few tests and find out that instead of ovaries and uterus, she actually carries a skull and that she has a y chromosome.
It is important to understand that one might think of this person as actually male, but they are not really.
Women, like men, have something in our bodies that is called adrenaline glands.
They are located in the back part of our body.
And the adrenal glands place androgens here, which are virilizing hormones.
Most women, like me—I think I’m a typical woman—I don’t know my actual chromosome structure, but I think I probably have the typical one—most women like me actually talk about androgen.
We are producing androgen and we are talking about androgen.
The result is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgen than a woman who was born with a head and has an androgen receptor defect.
Gender is therefore really complicated; intersexuals are not only in the non-spectrum of gender – in a certain sense, they can be spread across the entire bandwidth.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19-year-old man who was born as a boy, raised as a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, lived as a man, and he had just discovered that he had ovaries and a womb.
He had an extreme form of congenital adrenal hyperblasia.
At the age of xx chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were so strongly active that they essentially produced a male hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculine, his brain was exposed to the more typical male part of the hormone spectrum.
And when he was born, he looked like a boy—no one knew anything.
And only when he turned 19, he got enough medical problems, in fact, because he was menstruating internally, that the doctors found out that he was inwardly female.
Okay, just another quick example for a variant of intersexuality.
Some men develop something with xx chromosomes, which is called ovotestis, whey eggstockgewebe von hodengewebe umhüllt is.
We do not know exactly why this happens.
Gender can also occur in many different variants.
The reason why children with this type of body – be it zwergenwuchs or Siamese twins, or intersex – are often adjusted by surgeons to the norm is not because this would be beneficial for their physical health.
In many cases, these people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why different types of surgical interventions are often performed is because they threaten our social categories.
Typically, our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomical expression is accompanied by a particular identity.
We also have the concept that being a woman means having a female identity; being a black person means, supposedly, having an African anatomy in terms of one’s own history.
So we have this terribly simplified idea.
And when we are faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us, it confuses us in terms of these categorizations.
We also have a lot of more romantic ideas about individualism in our culture.
And our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Now you can imagine how astonishing it is when children are born who are two persons in one body.
Where I had experienced the most excitement lately, was the South African runner Caster Semenya last year, whose gender was questioned at the World Leichathletic Championship in Berlin.
Many journalists have called me with the question: "What test will you do that will tell us whether Caster Semenya is female or male?"
And I had to explain to the journalist that this test does not exist.
We now know that gender is complex enough that we must admit that nature does not draw a line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; in fact, we are the ones who make this line of separation natural.
We also have a situation where, the further our science progresses, we have to acknowledge more and more that those categories, which we had regarded as stable anatomical categories, which restored very simple associations in order to create lasting identity categories, are much more obscure than we assumed.
And this does not only apply to gender.
This also applies to race, which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has allowed.
In our considerations, we fall into all kinds of uncomfortable realms.
For example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
What should we start with the fact that we distinguish ourselves from them only by a few nucleotides?
As we continue to advance our science, we are increasingly entering a zone of discomfort where we must acknowledge that the simplistic categories we had are probably too simple.
We see this in all possible areas of human life.
One of the fields in which we see this to be seen, in our current culture, in today’s United States, are the struggles over the beginning and the end of life.
We have difficult discussions about the point at which a body becomes human, so that it has a right other than the fetal life.
We have very difficult debates these days –<unk> not as publicly as in medicine – about the question of when someone is dead.
In the past, our ancestors had no difficulty struggling with the question of when someone died.
Someone has at most held a feather under their nose, and when it moved, they have not yet buried it.
When she stopped moving, she was buried.
But today we are in a situation where we take vital organs from humans and want to transplant them to other humans.
And as a result, we get caught up in the struggle with the really difficult question, when someone is dead, and that brings us into a really difficult situation, where we no longer have as simple categories as before.
Now you could assume that the whole collapse of categories would make someone like me really happy.
I am politically progressive, I verteidige people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit, it makes me nervous.
To realize that these categories are really much more uncertain than we thought, makes me nervous.
And it makes me nervous when it comes to thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about this tension, I must first confess that I am a big fan of the founding fathers.
I know you were racist, I know you were sexist, but you were great.
I find that they were so brave and strong, and so radical in what they did that every couple of years I get caught watching the smalzige musical of 1776, and it's not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten.
It is because of what happened in 1776 with the founder.
The founding fathers were, in my view, the original anatomical activists, and that is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept, and they replaced it with another, which was radical and beautiful, and 200 years was crucial for us.
As they all remember, our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplified concept of anatomy.
The rulers of the old world did not have a concept based on DNA, but they had a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They were of the view that people who had political power should have this political power because of the inherited bloodline from grandfather to father to son and so on.
The founding fathers rejected this idea and replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and this concept said that all humans were created equal.
They leveled the playing field and decided that anatomically, the commonalities counted, not the difference, and that was very radical.
Now they did this in part because they were part of an enlightenment system in which two things grew up together.
Democracy has grown, but at the same time science has grown.
If you look at the history of the founding fathers, it becomes clear that many of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalist world.
They went away from statements of a supernatural nature, and brought back things, such as a supernatural concept of power, where the transmission is based on a very vague concept of birthright.
They moved toward a naturalist concept.
And when you look at the Declaration of Independence, for example, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don’t talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as part of this, they provided us with a concept that dealt with anatomical commonalities.
And thus they have really wonderfully prepared the future civil rights movement.
They didn’t think so about it, but what they did for us was great.
What happened years afterwards?
For example, women who sought the right to vote used the concept of the Founding Fathers, which says that anatomical commonality is more important than the anatomical difference, and said, “that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough as the difference, that we should not have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc., etc.”
And the women argued that successfully.
Next came the successful bourgeois rights movement, where we saw men as survivors of truth, who spoke about it, "I am not a woman?" &quot;
We find men in the marching ranks of the civil justice movement who say, "I am a man."
Again, people of different skin colors, who rely on anatomical commonalities before anatomical differences, again, successfully.
We see the same with the disability rights movement.
Of course, the problem is that as we begin to consider all those commonalities, we must begin to ask in question why we maintain certain separations.
Well, I would like to maintain certain trends, anatomically speaking, in our culture.
For example, I don’t want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don’t want to say that we should avoid anatomy altogether.
I do not want to say that 5-year-olds should have the right to give their consent to sex or to marry.
There are also some anatomical differences that make sense to me, and which we should, I think, keep.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are and why we keep them, and whether they make sense.
So let’s go back to these two beings who were conceived at the beginning of the story.
We have two beings, both not 1979 are exactly the same tag.
Imagine that one of them, Maria, was born three months prematurely, she was also born on June 1, 1980.
Heinrich, on the other hand, is born on the date of birth, he is also born on March 1, 1980,
Only because of the fact that Maria was born 3 months prematurely, she obtains all possible rights three months before Heinrich – the right to have consensual sex, the right to choose, the right to drink.
Heinrich has to wait for all of this, not because he actually has another biological alter, only because of the time of his birth.
We also find other curiosities regardless of what their rights are.
Heinrich, since one assumes that he is masculine—although I didn’t tell you that he is mit xy—since one assumes that he is masculine, he can now be referred to, which Maria does not have to worry about.
Maria, on the other hand, cannot exercise in all states the same right that Heinrich has in all states, namely the right to marry.
Heinrich can marry a woman in any state, but Mary can only marry a woman in a few states today.
We also have these permanent anatomical categories that are problematic and fragile in many ways.
And for me the question arises: what will we do as our science makes such advances in the field of anatomy that we reach a point where we must admit that a democracy based on anatomy could disintegrate?
I don’t want to give up on science, but at the same time it sometimes feels like science is making itself independent.
So where are we going?
It seems as if our culture would take an art of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw a line somewhere, so we draw it somewhere."
But a lot of people are trapped in a very strange position.
So, for example, Texas has decided at one point that marrying a man means that you do not have an Y chromosome, and marrying a woman means that you have an Y chromosome.
Now in practice, humans are not tested for their chromosomes.
But it’s also very weird, because of the story I told you first about the androgen receptor defect.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us in his “I have a trauma rede” an art solution.
He says, we should not judge people by their skin color, but by the character properties of their character, and thus goes beyond anatomy.
And I would like to say, &quot;Yes, that sounds like a really good idea. &quot;
But how do we do this in practice?
How do we judge people based on their characteristics?
I would also like to point out that I am not sure that we should distribute rights in relation to people like this, because I must admit that I know a number of golden retrievers, who probably deserve social benefits more than some people I know.
I would like to say that I probably also know some helle labrador dogs, who are more capable of making fundiertere, intelligentere and mature decisions regarding their sexual relationships than some 40-year-olds I know.
So how should we operate the question of character properties?
It turns out to be really difficult out.
And a part of me is wondering, what if the content of a personality was something that could be machine-readable in the future – could be made visible through fmri?
Do we really want to go in that direction?
I’m not sure where we’re going.
What I know is that it really seems important to think about the idea that the US is the leader in thinking about issues of democracy.
In our pursuit of democracy we have done our thing really well, and I think we would do our thing well in the future.
We do not have the situation, as is the case in Iran, for example, where a man who feels sexually attracted to other men is punished with death unless he is willing to undergo a gender change, in which case he is allowed to remain alive.
These kinds of conditions do not exist with us.
I am glad to be able to say that we do not have these conditions – a surgeon I spoke with a few years ago who had a couple of Siamese twins with him to separate them, in part to make a name.
But when I spoke to him on the phone and asked him why he was doing these interventions – they were highly risky operations – his answer was that in his country, these children would be treated very badly, and so he had to do it.
I replied, “Have you considered political asylum instead of an operation to separate them?”
The United States offers incredible possibilities to allow people to be who they are without having to change their state.
That’s why I think we have to be the leader.
To conclude, I would like to note that I’ve talked a lot about the fathers.
And I would like to think about the possibilities of what democracy could look like, or could have looked like, if we had those mothers more involved.
And I want to say something that is somewhat radical for a feminist, namely, I think that there could be different kinds of insights that prevail from different types of anatomy, especially when people apply a group thinking.
For years, because I was interested in intersexuality, I have also been interested in research in the field of gender differences.
And one of the things that I found really interesting is the difference between men and women in how they think and act in the world.
What we have learned from cross-cultural studies is that women, on average – not all, but on average – are more likely to pay much attention to complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group.
Therefore, when we think about it, we have an interesting situation ahead of us.
Years ago, when I was in a graduate school, one of my student supervisors, who knew my interest in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, so kill it still — asked me a really strange question.
He said, &quot;Tell me what feminism is. &quot;
And I thought, “Well, that’s the dumbest question I’ve ever heard.
In feminism it is about dissolving clichés over gender, so nothing is feminine in feminism.
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought that there could be something feminist in feminism.
That is to say, there could be something, on average, which differentiates the female brain from the male, which makes us more attentive to highly complex social relationships, and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
Where the founding fathers were also extremely thoughtful to find out how individuals could be protected from the state, it is possible that, if we incorporate more mothers into this concept, we more a concept of combating, not only how to protect, but how we can take care of each other.
And<unk> this is where we must go in the future if we take democracy beyond anatomy—think less about the individual body in terms of identity, and more about relationships.
So when we as a people try to restore a more perfect connection, we think about what we can do for each other.
Many thanks.
My name is Jesse and this is my suitcase.
But before I show them what I have in it, I will make a very public confession, and that is: I am obsessed with outfits.
I love to find, wear, and in recent times also to photograph and blog at every opportunity a different colorful, crazy outfit.
But I’m not buying anything new.
I get all my second-hand clothes at flohmärkten and in second-hand shops.
Ooh, thank you very much.
Second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my wardrobe on the environment and also on my wallet.
I meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually serve a good purpose; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping my very personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what will I find today?
Will it be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it cost less than $20?
When all the answers are yes, I feel like I’ve won.
I will return to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at Ted.
I mean, what does someone bring with so many outfits?
I will also show you exactly what I have accompanied.
I’ve had seven couples of underwear, and that’s all.
Wearing it for exactly a week is all I have in my suitcase.
I bet I would find everything else I might want to wear if I first came to Palm Springs.
And since you have not heard of me as the woman who runs around here at Ted in her underwear – that means, I have found a couple of things.
And I definitely want to show you my outfits for this week.
Does that sound good?
As I do this, I will also share with you some of the lessons that I, whether you believe it or not, have learned from these adventures, nothing new to bear.
Let’s start with Sunday.
I don’t think it’s the strange tiger.
You don’t have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always look great for less than $50.
This entire outfit, including the jacket, cost me 55 dollars, and it was the most expensive piece I’ve worn in this whole week.
Montag color is something powerful.
It is fast physiologically impossible to be badly behaved when you wear hellrote hose.
When you are happy, you attract other happy people.
Tuesday: Adjustment is totally overrated.
I have spent a great deal of my life trying to be myself and at the same time adapting.
Just be aware of who they are.
If you surround yourself with the right people, you will not only understand it, you will also appreciate it.
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people say to me, I look like I’m dressing up and playing, or that I remember her seven-year-old.
I then smile and say, &quot;Thank you beautifully. &quot;
Self-confidence is the key.
If you think you look good in something, then it’s almost<unk> so.
And if you think you don’t look good in something, you’re probably also right.
I grew up with a mother who taught me day by day.
But only when I turned 30, I really understood what that meant.
I will summarize this briefly for you.
If you believe that you are a wonderful person inside and out, then there is nothing you can’t wear.
There is no excuse for anyone here in this audience.
We should be able to rock whatever we want.
Many thanks.
Friday: a universal truth – five words: goldene pailleten fit to everything.
And ultimately, samstag: developing your own, unique, personal style is a great way to tell the world something about yourself without having to say a word.
It has been proven to me over and over again, when people came to me this week, simply because of what I wore and I had great conversations.
Obviously, not everything will fit in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I will spend it all over again.
For the lesson that I myself am trying to learn this week is that it’s okay to let go.
I don’t have to attach to these things emotionally, because right around the corner there will always be another crazy, colorful, radiant outfit, which only awaits me when I have a little love in my heart and it seeks.
I would like to thank you many times.
Thank you very much.
Good day, all together.
I have something here that I want to show you.
Think of this as a picture point, as a flying picture point.
This is what we call perceptible design in our laboratory.
Let me tell you a little about it.
If you take this picture – I’m originally an Italian, and every young man in Italy grows up with this picture in his room. but the reason why I tell you this is that something very interesting has happened in Formula 1 over the past decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, they won the race.
Nowadays, if you want to win a race, do you actually need something like this here – something that the car monitors in real time, has a few thousand sensors that transmit information from the car, that information to the system and then process it and then use it to send back that auto decisions and change things in real time while information is collected.
In engineering teams, they would call this a real-time control system.
And basically, it is a system that consists of two parts – a sensing part and a reactive part.
What is interesting today is that real-time control systems are beginning to emerge in our lives.
In the last few years, our cities have just been equipped with networks and electronics.
You will become a computer in the free.
And as a computer in the free, they begin to react in different ways, they are perceived and driven.
If we build cities, that’s actually a big deal.
By the way, I would like to mention that cities only account for two percent of the earth’s surface, but 50 percent of the world’s population lives there.
They account for 75% of energy consumption – accounting for up to 80% of CO2 emissions.
So if we do something with those cities, that’s a big deal.
Beyond the cities, bring all this perception and drive into objects of everyday life.
This is from an exhibition, organized by paola antonelli for moma later in the year, during the summer.
It means &quot;speak with me. &quot;
Now, all our objects, our environment, are beginning to talk back to us.
In a sense, it’s almost as if every atom out there becomes both a sensor and an operator.
And that radically changes the interaction that we humans have with our outside environment.
In a certain way, it is fast as if the old trauma of Michelangelo ...
You know, when Michelangelo formed Moses, it is said that he finally took the hammer and threw it on Moses – in fact you can still see a small star untendrunter – and said, cried, “Why don’t you talk?
Now, today, our environment begins to respond to us for the first time.
I will only show you a few examples – again, with the idea of perceiving and driving our environment.
Let us start with the perception.
Now the first project I want to introduce to you is in fact one of the first of our labs.
It was created four and a half years ago in Italy.
And what we did was actually use a new type of network that was then deployed around the world – that is, a cellular phone network – and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, which is collected by the operator anyway, to understand how the city works.
That summer was a happy summer – 2006.
It was when Italy won the World Cup.
Some of them will remember, it was as Italy played against France, and then am ende zidane, der kopfstoß.
And no matter what, Italy has finally won.
Now you can see what happened on that tag, only by observing the activity that happens on the network.
Here you can see the city.
You can see in there not the Colosseum, the flow of Tiber.
Tomorrow is the game ahead of them.
You can see the Zeitachse above.
Early in the afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving.
The game begins with silence.
France makes a tower, Italy makes a tower.
Half time, people make a short call, go to the toilet.
The second half-time ends with the normal game time.
The first extension, the second.
Zidane, in a moment of a headshot.
Italy wins, yes.
Now, that night, everyone went into the center to celebrate.
You have seen the great outcome.
On the next day, everyone went to the center to meet the winner team and the prime minister at the same time.
Then everybody went down.
They see the picture of the Circo massimo square, where, since Roman times, people went to celebrate – to have a big party, and they see the outbreak at the end of the days.
Now, this is just one example of how we can feel the city today, in a way that we couldn’t do a few years ago.
Another quick example for feelings: this is not about people, but about things that we use and consume.
Nowadays, we know everything about where our stuff comes from.
This is a map that shows you all the chips from which a Mac computer consists, how they came together.
But we know very little about where those things go.
So in this project we actually designed a few small markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system.
We also started with some volunteers who helped us, just over a year ago, in Seattle, to mark the things that they throw away – different kinds of things as they can see – things that they would throw away anyway.
Then we have the small chips, the small marks, glued to the garbage and started to pursue it.
Here are the results we just got.
From Seattle...
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can do the same things with less energy.
These data were not available before.
But that happens a lot of useless transportation and more complicated things.
The other thing, however, is that we believe that when we see each tag, the cup we throw away does not simply disappear, that it is still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle that we throw away every day still remains there.
And if we show this to people, then we can drive a change in behavior.
That is the reason for this project.
My colleague, assaf biderman, could tell you much more about perceiving and the many other wonderful things that can be done with perceiving, but I would like to come to talk about the second part, which we discussed at the beginning and that is the activation of our environment.
And the first project is something we did a few years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question from the mayor who came to us and said that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using public spaces as part of architecture.
And the question was: how could technology, new technologies be connected to it?
And one of the ideas that was identified in a working circle was to imagine these tubes, and valves, magnetic valves, valves, which open and close.
They caused it like a wasservorhang with picture points from a wasser.
When these image points fall down, you can write on them, you can display patterns, images, text.
and they can approach him, and he will open up to let them jump through, as you can see in this picture.
Now, we’ve introduced the mayor Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we were commissioned to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it the Digital Wasser Pavilion.
The whole building was made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when they approach it, it will open and let them in.
The roof was also covered with water.
And if it is windy, if you want to reduce the sprinkling, you can even drop the roof.
or they could close the building and the entire architecture will, as in this case, you know, these days, when you shut down the roof, you get pictures of people who were there and say, "They destroyed the building." &quot;
No, they have not destroyed the building, it is only that the architecture is almost disappearing.
Here you can see how the building works.
You see the person who asks what’s going on inside.
And here you can see me, as I tried not to get wet while testing the sensors that open the laundry.
Now, I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
But in fact, it was an even bigger fun that night.
All the children from Zaragoza came to the building, because the way they played with the building was very different.
No longer a building that would open up to let them in, but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water, you had to jump now without getting wet.
And that was, for us, very exciting, because as architects, engineers, as designers, we always think about how the people who use the things we design.
But the reality is always unpredictable.
And that’s the beautiful thing about creating things that are used and interacting with people.
Here is a picture of the building with the physical points of view, the points of view from the waters and the projections on it.
And that’s what made us think about the following project, which I’m showing you now.
In the face of these pictorial points, they could really begin to fly.
Imagine, you could have small hubschraubers flying through the air, and each of them with a small spot with changing light – almost like a cloud that can move through the room.
Here is the video.
Imagine a hubschrauber, like the one you’ve seen before, moving with others, completely synchronous.
You can have these clouds.
They can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this – a uniform formation in two dimensions.
or irregularly but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the image points.
You can play with different species.
It could simply appear in different formats or sizes, in different resolutions.
But then the whole could only be a 3D cloud of image points, to which they can access and through which they can move through, which they can see from many, many directions.
Here you can see a real flyfire-steuerung, which falls down to form a uniform v like before.
When they turn on the light, it looks the same as we’ve seen it before.
Imagine that each individual is controlled by human beings.
Each image could have an impulse that comes from humans, from the movements of humans, or the like.
I want to show you something here first.
We worked with Roberto Bolle, one of the best ballet dancers of our time – the star at the Metropolitan Theatre in New York and the scala in Milan – we recorded his movements in 3D to use them as an impulse for the flyfire.
Here you can see Roberto Tanzen.
On the left side you can see the picture points, the different imprints of prisoners.
It is a real-time 3D scan and a motion recording at the same time.
So that you can understand the whole movement.
You can do this all the time.
But then, once we have all the image points, they can play with them and play with color motion gravity and twist movement.
We would like to use this as a possible impulse for the flyfire.
I want to show you the latest project we are working on.
It’s something we work on for the Olympic Games in London.
It’s called the cloud – the cloud.
The idea, in turn, is to imagine that we are once again involving people to do something and change the environment – almost something, as we call it, cloud movement, like moving a shonentor, but with a cloud.
Imagine that anyone can make a small donation for a picture point.
I think the remarkable thing about the events of the last few years, the last decades, is that we have shifted from a physical world to a digital world.
that has digitized everything, knowing, and making it accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time – and the Obama campaign has shown that – we can move from the digital world, from the self-organizing forces of networks to the physical world.
It may, in our case, be that we use it to design and create a symbol.
This means something that was built in the city.
But tomorrow, in order to face the upcoming challenges – think about climate change or the CO2 emissions – how can we then move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is also that we actually involve those people, in which they do things together, collectively.
The cloud is again a cloud of image points, just as a real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And these particles are wasser, while our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
It’s a physicalisches formed in London, but covered with picture points.
They can move inside and have different kinds of experiences.
They can actually look at it from below, share the most important moments for the 2012 Olympics and beyond, and use it as a way of connecting to the community.
So both, the physical clouds in the sky and something at the top of which they can walk, like London's new mountain summit.
You can go in.
and a kind of digital lighthouse at night – but most importantly, a new kind of experience for all who want to go to the top.
Thank you thanks.
As an artist, the context is very important to me.
Through my work I try to express that human beings are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
The first time I was in Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.
I was captured by Ehrfurcht.
My heart grew, I was dizzying while I was trying to grasp what was standing in front of me.
The icebergs around me pulled<unk> 60 meters out of the watershed and I could only be surprised that it was one snowflake on another snowflake, year by year.
Icebergs were born as the crust of a glacier or by breaking out of ice shells.
Each eisberg has its own individual personality.
They interact clearly with their surroundings and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and cling to the bitter end, while others can no longer withstand it and collapse in an attack of dramatic passion.
When you look at an iceberg, it is easy to think that they are isolated, separate and alone, just as we humans often see ourselves.
But the truth is far from that.
While an iceberg fades, I breathe in its premature atmosphere.
While the iceberg smelt, it is mineral-rich drinking water free, which nourishes many life forms.
When I take pictures of these icebergs, I act as if I were portraying my ancestors, aware that in these individual moments they exist in this way, and will never exist again.
It is not the truth when they melt; it is not the end, but a continuation of their paths along the life cycle.
One part of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young – a few thousand years old.
And part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you show a iceberg that I photographed in Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
Very rarely one actually witnesses a rolling iceberg.
Here you can see it now.
On the left side you can see a small boot.
That’s about five meters long.
Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is located on the water line.
You can see here, it starts rolling, and the boot has moved to the other side, where the man stands there.
That’s the average size of a Greenland iceberg.
It is raised about 120 feet from the wasser, or 40 meters.
And this video is in real time.
And simply so, the iceberg shows you a different side of his personality.
I thank you.
My life is truly remarkably blessed by working on some amazing projects.
But the coolest thing I’ve worked on, it was about this guy.
His name is Temptation.
Tempt was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 80s.
Then, one day, he came back from running and said, “Daddy, my legs are crying.”
And that was the outbreak of the as.
The temptation is completely paralyzed today.
He can only use his eyes.
I stand in front of him.
I have a company that makes design and animations, graffiti is also necessarily a more complex part of what we admire and respect in the art world.
We have therefore decided to support Tony – Tempt – and his case.
I met with his father and his brother and said, “We will give you this money.
What will you do with it? &quot;
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to get back with him and I asked: “For a moment, can’t that – I’ve seen Stephen Hawking – can’t all paralyzed humans communicate through these devices?”
And he replied, “No, only if you belong to the higher society class and have a remarkable insurance, can you really do that.
These devices are not accessible to normal people. &quot;
And I said, “How do you communicate now?” &quot;
Has anyone seen the movie "Schmetterling und Taucherglocke" ?
So they communicate – so they run their fingers entlang.
I wonder: &quot;Very archaic, how can that be? &quot;
So I came with the need, just to issue a check and instead I issued a check, of which I had no idea how to redeem it.
I made a commitment to his brother and father – with the words: “Well, my proposal is as follows: Tony will speak, we will provide him with an apparatus and we will find a way that he can do his art again.
For it is a farce that someone who still carries all this in himself cannot communicate it. &quot;
I also spoke a few months later at a conference.
I met these people from grl, the graffiti research lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw with a laser pointer on it that only records the negative area.
So they move around and make art installations like this.
They say that all things that are shown above follow a lifecycle.
It starts with the gender parts, then comes the schimpfwörter, then the bush-verleumdungen and finally those people actually make art.
But there was always a lifecycle in her presentations.
So I went home and ate with my wife in the evening and told her about everything and we thought, "Well, second time, if there is this technology with which one can use his eyes to control things, then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser so that it can make graffiti again, that would be brilliant."
That was the beginning of the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of things, we have achieved some things.
First, we have the insurances that inserted the doors, and we have actually got for tempt a device with which he can communicate – a Stephen Hawking machine.
That was incredible.
And he’s really extremely funny – I call him yoda, because you talk to him, or get an email, and think, “I’m so worthless, this guy is incredible.”
In addition, we have seven programmers from all over the world – literally from all corners of the world – flown to us home.
My wife, my children and I have been dragged into the garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists have taken over our house.
Many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do this and that we would come back and all the pictures on the wind would be graffiti wiped away.
But for over two weeks we programmed, we went to the promenade in Venice, my children were involved, my dog too, and we created it here.
It’s called eyewriter and you can see the description.
This is a cheap sunglasses we bought on the promenade of Venice, some copper wire and a few items from the market and the electronics trade.
We took a PS3 camera, built it up, put it on a LED light and now we have a device that is freely accessible – you can build it yourself, we make the code available for free, the software can be downloaded for free.
We also created a device that is completely free of restrictions.
No insurance can dispute.
Not even a hospital.
Every paralysed person can now actually communicate or draw with his eyes alone.
Thank you thanks.
Thank you very much, it was incredible.
At the end of the two weeks, we went back to Temptation’s Room.
I love this picture because it’s someone else’s room and that’s his room.
Now all this rumble is before the great revelation.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, nudel parties and overnight work, you painted Tony again for the first time in seven years.
And this is an impressive picture, because this is his life-support system, and he looks beyond his life-support system.
We have bent his bed so that he can see outside.
We installed a projector against a wall of parking spaces in front of the hospital.
And he painted again for the first time, in the presence of his family and friends – and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot.
Funnyly, we also had to break into the parkplatz, and we also felt excited as part of the sprayer scene.
I am still sending us an email with the following content: &quot;For the first time in seven years, I have drawn something.
I feel like I was pushed under water and finally someone grabbed me down and pulled my head up so that I could breathe.
Isn’t that overwhelming?
This is something like our fighting scream.
This keeps us on the brink and allows us to continue to develop.
And we still have a lot to improve on this device.
It’s an amazing device, but it comes from a magic table.
And someone who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more.
We are also in the process of finding out how to do it better, faster and stronger.
Since then, we have received all kinds of recognition.
We won a few prizes.
Remember, it is free, no one of us deserves it.
It all comes from our own pockets.
The awards were also &quot;oh, that’s fantastic. &quot;
Armstrong tweeted about us and then, in December, the Time magazine honored us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, which was really classy.
The coolest thing about it is – and that includes the whole circle – that this April, at the geffen moca in der innerstadt von los angeles, there will be an exhibition named &quot;art of the streets &quot;.
And there will probably be pretty much the toughest representatives of the street art scene – banksy, shepard fairey, caws – all these guys will be there.
Tempt will be part of the show, which is quite out of place.
Basically, I also think that if you see something that is impossible, then make it possible.
Everything in this room was impossible – this stage, this computer, this microphone, the eyewriter – everything was impossible at some point.
Make it possible – you are all here.
I am not a programmer and have never had anything to do with eye capture technology, but I just caught something and surrounded myself with amazing people so that we could put something on those legs together.
And this question should be asked by each of them on every single day, when they notice something that needs to be done. if not now, when then? and if not me, who then?
I thank you.
So, I write for children, and I’m probably America’s most read children’s book writer.
And I always tell people that I don’t want to come like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leder, but no one has ever chosen a farmer.
Today I want to tell you about circles and revelations.
Well, an enlightenment is usually something that one finds because one has dropped it somewhere.
You go around the block and take it as a revelation war.
This is a painting of a circle.
One of my friends did it – Richard Bollingbroke.
It is the art of the more complicated circle of which I want to tell you today.
My circle began in the 60s at the high school in Stow, Ohio, where I was a classmate.
I was the one who was beaten every week in the green and blue toilet until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the classroom.
They did it in secret.
It lasted for three years,
I had to leave the city.
I had a thumb, I had $85, and it struck me to San Francisco in California – I found a lover – and then in the 80s I found it important to get a job at AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night, I received a call from this teacher, a postwoman, who said, “I need to see her.
I am sad that we never met each other as adults.
If you can, please come to Ohio, and please come with the man I know you have already found.
and I should mention that I have bacterial cancer, and that I want them to hurry. &quot;
The next day we were in Cleveland.
We saw her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew she must be in a hospice.
We found one for her, we brought her, and we took care of her, and we gave to her family eight, because it was necessary.
It was something that we knew to tun.
And just when the woman who wanted to get to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a basket full of ashes and was laid in my hands.
What happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle – and the revelation of which I spoke was revealed.
The revelation is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life, and my partner and I saved her.
And you know, this part of life needs all that the rest of life needs.
We need truth and beauty, and I am so glad that this has been mentioned so often here today.
We need the same – we need love and pleasure – and it’s up to us to give these things.
Many thanks.
Imagine a huge explosion as you climb to a height of 1,000 meters.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a drive that makes klack, klack, klack, klack, klack, klack, klack.
This sounds like an influential fear.
Now, I had a unique place on that tag; I sat on 1D.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendant.
So I looked at them immediately, and they said, “No problem, we’ve probably picked up a few birds.”
The pilot had already turned the machine and we were not so far away.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot directed the machine toward the Hudson River.
This is usually not the route.
Turn off the drive ab.
Imagine a noisy plane.
And then he said three words – the most emotional words I’ve ever heard.
is said, &quot; ready to make up &quot;;
I didn’t have to talk to the board staff anymore.
I could see it in their eyes, it was terrible, life was over.
Now I want to tell you three things that I learned about myself on this day.
I learned that in a moment everything is different.
We have this life plan, we have these things that we want to do in life, and I thought of all those people to whom I wanted to give a hand and it didn’t, all those fences that I wanted to flicken, all those experiences that I wanted to do and never did.
As I thought about it later, I came across a saying that reads: “I collect bad wines.”
For if the wine is full and the person is there, then I will open it.
I do not want to postpone anything in my life anymore.
And this urgency, this soul, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned on this tag – and that was, when we missed the George Washington Bridge, so pretty much about the hair width – then I thought, mensch, there is one thing that I really regret.
I had a good life.
In my own humanity and with my mistakes, I strived to become better in everything I packaged.
But in my humanity, I have also given my ego space.
And I regretted the time I had wasted on meaningless things, with people who mean something.
And I thought about the relationship with my wife, with friends, with people.
And then, when I thought about it, I decided to banish negative energy from my life.
It’s not perfect, but it’s much better.
For two years, I haven’t quarrelled with my wife.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy.
the third thing I learned – and that is, while the inner clock begins, &quot;15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; to count down,
You can see the water coming.
I said, &quot; please fly in the air. &quot;
I don’t want this thing in 20 to break you apart, as you know from the documentation.
While we abstracted, I had this feeling, mensch, to die is not furchterregend.
It’s as if we’re preparing for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn’t want to go; I love my life.
And this sadness really formed in one thought, namely that I only wish for one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow up.
About a month later, I attended a performance of my daughter – first class, not much artistic talent ...
...not yet.
And I celebrate, I cry like a small child.
Everything in the world had a meaning for me.
It became clear to me then, by linking these points together, that in life it is only about being a great father.
More than anything else, my only soul in life is to be a good father.
It was a miracle for me not to die on this day.
I was given another gift, namely to see into the future, and to come back and live differently.
My call to all who fly today is: Imagine the same thing happening on your flight – please don’t – but imagine it; and how would you change?
What would they do that they postpone because they think they would be there forever?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything else, are they the best parents you can only be?
Thank you thanks.
The idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is quite simple in itself.
We do not want Iran to build the bomb.
The most important facility for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranium enrichment facility in natanz.
The gray boxes you see here are real-time control systems.
If we now succeed in compromising the systems that control the switches and valves, then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
These gray boxes do not run with Windows software; they are based on a completely different technology.
But if we manage to locate an effective Windows virus on a laptop that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this grey box, then we are in business.
And that’s the planning behind stuxnet.
Let’s start with a Windows dropper.
the usage data is transferred to the grey box, the centrifuge is damaged and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed – the order is executed.
This is a child’s game, isn’t it?
I want to tell you how we found out.
When we started our research on stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of this construction was.
The only thing we know is that it is very, very complicated, what the windows part concerns, the dropper part, the power of countless zero-day weaknesses.
And there seemed to be a bit of prejudice, with these grey boxes, these real-time control systems.
This caught our attention and we started a laboratory project, in which we infected our environment with stuxnet, and examined this construction.
Then something strange happened.
Stuxnet behaved like a laboratory rat, who didn’t like our cheese, but didn’t want to eat it.
It made no sense in my eyes.
And after we experimented with different types of cheese, I realized that this was a targeted attack.
Fully directed at a particular soul.
the dropper strives to be active on the grey box when a special configuration has been discovered, even when the special program that tries to infect it runs on that soul.
And if not, then the stuxnet is nothing.
So, it really aroused my interest and we started working on it, almost around the clock, because I thought, well, we don’t know what the soul is.
For example, it could be an American power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So we should better soon find out what the soul represents.
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code and found that it is structured into two digital explosives – one smaller and one larger.
And we also noticed that they were very professionally constructed by people who obviously had all the insider information at their disposal.
They knew all the bits and bytes they had to attack.
You probably even know the shoe size of the machine operator.
So they knew everything.
And if you have already realized that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you: the usage data is a science in itself.
It is much more challenging than anything we have ever seen.
Here you can see an excerpt from this attack code.
We are talking about about 15,000 zeilen codes.
It looks pretty much like an old-fashioned assembly language.
And I will tell you how we were able to become smart out of this code.
So what we were looking for first, we were calling for system functions, because we know what these effect.
And then we looked for timers and data structures and tried to connect them with the real world – with potential souls in the real world.
So we needed theories about these souls, which we could prove or refute.
In order to establish these theories, we remind ourselves that this is definitely a high-grade sabotage, it must be a high-quality soul and very likely it is in Iran, because there most infections were<unk>.
Now, there are not several thousand goals in this area.
Basically, it runs out to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and the uranium enrichment plant in natanz.
So I said to my assistant, "Bring me a list of all the experts for centrifuges and power plants from our customer base."
And I called her and applied her knowledge to compare her expertise with what we had found out in the code and in the data.
And that worked very well.
So, it was possible for us to connect the small digital sprengkopf with the rotor control.
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, then you are actually in a position to knock the rotor and eventually even let the centrifuge explode.
What we also found out is that the soul of the attack was actually to let it happen slowly and frighteningly – obviously in the attempt to let maintenance engineers despair, so that they would not be able to quickly get behind it.
The big digital breakthrough – we got a glimpse by looking very closely at data and data structures.
So, for example, the number 164 stands very out of this code; one cannot ignore it.
I began working through scientific literature on how these centrifuges are built in precision and found that they are structured in so-called cascades, and each cascade contains 164 centrifuges.
So it made sense, it fits together.
And it became even better.
These centrifuges in Iran are divided into 15 so-called planes.
And guess what we found in that attack code?
A virtually identical structure.
So again, it fits really well together.
And this gave us great confidence for what we investigated here.
Don’t misunderstand me, it wasn’t just that.
These results were achieved through several weeks of hard work.
And often we just ran into a sackgate and had to re-assemble.
In any case, we found that both digital explosives were actually directed at the same soul, but from different directions.
The small explosive head takes over a cascade, and overturns the rotors and slows them down, and the large explosive head enters with six cascades in interaction and manipulates valves.
So, overall, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the soul is.
It is accurate and it is just accurate.
So we don’t have to worry that other targets could be hit by stuxnet.
Here is something really cool zeug that we have discovered—has really pulled me out of the socket.
Below there is the gray box, and above it you can see the centrifuge.
Now, what this thing causes is that it captures the incoming values of sensors – also, for example, pressure sensors and vibration sensors – and it makes legitimate code available, which is still running during the attack, with false incoming data.
And in fact, this false input data from stuxnet has already been recorded before.
So it’s just like in Hollywood movies, where during the hunt the surveillance camera is fed with previously recorded video recordings.
That is cool, isn’t it?
The idea here is obviously not only that the machine operators in the control room overlisten.
In fact, it is even more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to overwhelm a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human machine operator cannot react quickly enough.
So in a power plant, for example, if the large steam turbine gets too fast, you have to open the discharge valve within milliseconds.
Of course, this cannot be done by a human machine driver.
So at this stage we need digital security systems.
And if they are in danger, then really bad things can happen.
The power plant could explode.
Neither the driver nor the safety system will notice it.
That is scary.
But it will get even worse.
And what I am saying now is very important.
This attack is generic.
There is nothing special to do with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
So, for example, it would work just as well – in a power plant or in an automobile factory.
It is generic.
And you don't have to - as the attacker - you don't have to place those utility data over a USB stick, as we saw at stuxnet.
Ordinary worm technology could also be used to spread.
You just need to spread it as far as possible.
And if you do that, you will eventually get a cyber-mass destruction weapon.
This is the consequence that we must face.
So unfortunately, the largest number of souls for such attacks does not lie in the Middle East.
They are located in the United States, in Europe and in Japan.
So all these green areas, these are the soul-richest surroundings.
We have to face the consequences and we get better at preparing ourselves.
Thank you thanks.
I have a question.
Ralph, there has been a lot of reports that people believe that there is the mossad, the main organization behind it.
Is that also your opinion?
Do you really want to know that?
Okay okay.
According to my opinion, the Mossad is involved, but the driving force is not Israel.
So the driving force behind it is the cyber-superpower.
There is only one and that is the United States – fortunately, fortunately.
Otherwise, our problem would be even bigger.
Thank you for bringing us a heidenangst. thank you Ralph.
I have spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somehow dangerous.
I went to prison – difficult.
I worked in a coal mine – dangerous.
I’ve filmed in war zones – difficult and dangerous.
And I’ve spent 30 days with it, nothing but eating this here – fun in the beginning, a bit difficult in the not, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, for the most part of my career I have exposed myself to the appearance of terrible situations, and all this only in an attempt to study social interests so that they are engaging and interesting, and hopefully in a way that makes them understandable, which makes them entertaining and accessible to the public.
So if I knew I would come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would do something a bit different.
Some of you may have heard that a few weeks ago I posted an advertisement on eBay.
I sent a few Facebook news, a few Twitter news, and I gave people the opportunity to get the name rights on my 2011 tedtalk.
Indeed, some lucky individuals and firms, for-profit and non-profit, were given the unique opportunity – because I am sure Chris Anderson will never allow it again – to buy the name rights to the talk they are currently seeing, which at the time had neither a title nor much content and did not have many indications of what the theme would actually be.
Their name was presented here: my tedtalk, of whom they have no idea what the theme will be, and which could fly to their ears, especially if I let their company for their participation be stupid.
But apart from that, it’s a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people watch these tedtalks?
A whole lot.
By the way, this is just the job title.
Despite this warning, I also knew that somebody would buy those name rights.
If they had asked me about this a year ago, I would not have been able to tell them with certainty.
But in the new project I am working on, my new film, we explore the world of marketing, advertising.
As I have said, over the years I have been in some pretty terrible situations, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could equip me for something as difficult and dangerous as going into a room with this guy.
You know, I had the idea for a movie.
What I want to do is a film about product placement, marketing and advertising, with the entire film being financed by product placement, marketing and advertising.
And the film will be called &quot;the greatest movie ever sold &quot;.
Also in &quot;the greatest movie ever sold &quot;Happened, is that everything, from top to bottom, from beginning to end, is completely marked—from the title sponsor you will see in the film, that is the mark x.
Now this brand, the qualcomm stadium, the staples center ...
These people will be connected to the film in eternity – forever.
And so the film will examine this whole idea—that is what? in eternity, forever?
I am a redundant person.
This was more to emphasize.
It was &quot;in eternity, forever. &quot;
But we will not only have the brand X as the title sponsor, but we will make sure that we sell every possible category in the film.
So maybe we sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe they’ve ever worn...
The greatest car you’ve ever driven, from &quot;the greatest movie ever sold &quot;the greatest drink you’ve ever had, an attention from &quot;the greatest movie ever sold &quot;.
So the idea is, besides showing that brands are a part of life, actually getting them to finance the film?
And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The heart of the whole film is transparency.
You will see the whole thing in the movie of statten go.
So that’s the whole concept, the whole film, from the beginning to the end.
And I would be glad if ceg would help to realize this.
You know, it’s funny, because when I first heard it, it’s the ultimate respect for the audience.
But I don’t know how sensitive people will be.
You have a perspective – I don’t want to use the “blickwinkel” because it has a negative connotation – but do you know how it will develop?
How much money is needed to realize this?
1.5 million.
I think it will be difficult to meet them, but I think it is definitely worth talking about some really well-known brands.
Who knows, when the movie comes out then, we might look like a horde of full-fooled idiots.
What do you think the answer will be?
The answer will most likely be &quot;no &quot;.
But is it a difficult thing because of the movies or a difficult thing because of me?
JK: Both of them.
So, it means not so optimistic.
So, my lord, can you help me? I need help.
I can help.
Okay okay.
Fantastically fantastic.
We have to think about which brands.
Yes yes.
If you look at the people you have to deal with...
There are a few points that we can turn to.
Turn off the camera.
I thought, “Put the camera off” would mean that we wanted to have a background conversation.
It turned out that in reality it meant, “We don’t want to have anything to do with your film.”
And so all these companies disappeared, one after the other.
No one wanted to have anything to do with the film.
I was astonished.
They didn’t want to have anything to do with the project.
And I was confused, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to present your product to as many people as possible, to see it to as many people as possible.
Especially in today’s world, at this intersection of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape, it is not the idea of being in this new and exciting medium of communication that brings this news to the masses.
No, that’s war, what I thought.
But you see, the problem was that my idea had a fatal error, and that was the following.
In fact, no, that was not the mistake at all.
That<unk>’t have been a problem at all.
That would have been okay.
But what this picture stands for is a problem.
You see, if you enter transparency in the Google search it is -- this is one of the first images that appear.
I really like your art, Sergey Brin.
That was the problem: transparency - free from deception and spotting, easy to discover and see through; immediately understandable; characterized by visibility and access to information, especially in terms of business practices - the last sail is<unk> the biggest problem.
You know, we’re hearing a lot about transparency right now.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEOs say it.
But when it comes to the extent that it is to be implemented, something changes.
But why? now, transparency is anxiety-effective – like this strange bear, which still screams.
It is unpredictable, like this strange road.
It is also very risky.
What else is risky?
A whole scale of cool whip eating.
This is very risky.
So when I started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, they said, “No, we want you to tell a story.”
We want you to tell a story, but we just want you to tell our story.
You see, when I was a child and my father caught me lying – and then he sits and looks at me with this look – he would say, “My son, there are three versions of each story.
There is your version, there is my version, and there is the true version.
So you see, with this movie we wanted to tell the true version.
But since only one company, an agency, was willing to help us — and this only because I have known John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I had to do it alone, I had to bypass the middle man and go directly with my team to the companies.
So what they suddenly began to understand—or what I started to understand—was that when you start talking to these companies, the idea of how your brand is understood is a comprehensive problem.
I have friends who make big, giant Hollywood movies, and I have friends who make small independent movies like me.
And my friends, who make great, giant Hollywood films, say that the reason why their films are so successful lies in the brand partner they have.
And then my friends, who make small independent films, say, “Well, how should we compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?”
And the movie is titled &quot;the greatest movie ever sold. &quot;
So how exactly will we see the ban in the movie?
Whenever I go on the road, and whenever I open the medical box, you will see a ban on deodorant.
And every time I interview someone, I can say, “Are you fresh enough for this interview?”
You look a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
Per<unk> you should also put up a little bit of this before the interview. &quot;
And then we offer one of these great fragrances.
either &quot;flower fusion &quot; or &quot;paradise winds &quot;, they will have the choice.
We will be equipped for both men and women – party, roll-on, or a stick, whatever.
This is the shortcut.
I can now answer all your questions and give you an exhaustive version.
We are a smaller brand.
As you have said about the smaller films, we as a brand are a challenger.
So we don’t have such a budget as other brands.
So to do such things – you know, remind people of a ban – that’s somehow why we’re interested.
Which words would you use to describe the ban?
Ban is blank.
That’s a great question.
Woman: superior technology.
Technology is not the art of describing something that someone under the asshole has.
We are speaking of kühn, fresh.
I think “fresh” is a super word that really makes this category something positive, as opposed to “fighting odor and moisture.”
It keeps you fresh.
How can we keep them fresh longer – better fresh, more fresh, dreimal fresher.
Such things have a more positive effect.
This is a million-dollar company.
What about me? what about the druchschittstypen?
I have to talk to the man on the street who is like me, the eight-normal consumer.
Tell me something about my brand.
How would you describe your brand?
Hmmm, my brand?
I do not know.
I really like beautiful clothes.
80s revival trifft on skaterpunk, except am waschtag.
Well, what is the brand Gerry?
Unique is unique.
I think the genre, the style I have, is probably &quot;dark glamour &quot;.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of gray shades and such a thing.
But usually I have an accessory, such as sunglasses, or a jewelry and so on.
If it were a brand, it would probably be a classic Mercedes cabrio.
Man 2: The brand I am is, I would say, a lazy fly.
woman 2: teils hippie, teils yogi, teils brooklyn-mädchen - I don't know.
Man 3: I am the shit-type.
I sell scumetiers all over the country, worldwide.
I think that’s my brand.
This is my brand in my small, distorted industry.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx, because I was an outsourcer.
Man 5: the brand of alcoholic sweaters.
Is it going?
I am a lawyer.
I am Tom.
Well, we may not all be that tom-brand, but I often see myself at the intersection of dark glamour and lazy flying.
And what was noticed was that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could penetrate my head, somebody who could really help me understand what one calls “brand personality.”
So I found a company named Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They have helped companies such as nestle, febreze, hallmark to discover this brand.
If you could do that, you could help me too.
You have your pictures withgebracht, right?
The first picture is a picture of my family.
Just tell me a little about how this relates to your thoughts and feelings about yourself.
These are the people who shape my worldview.
Tell me about this world.
I think that one’s own world is the world in which one lives—like people around one corner, friends, family, art, how one lives, works, and so on.
All these things originate and begin in one place, and for me they originate and begin with my family in West Virginia.
What is the next thing you want to talk about?
This was the most beautiful day of my life.
How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about yourself?
This is what I would like to be.
I like things that are different.
I like things that are strange, I like things that are strange.
Tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -phase -- what does it bring us?
What is the machete? in which puppet stage are you currently?
Why is it important not to start? what represents the rot?
Tell me a little about this part.
A little bit more about you, that you are not.
What other metamorphoses have you gone through?
It doesn’t have to be anxious. – In what kind of background are you?
No, thank you! thank you!
Thank you very much for your patience.
Well, well now well.
I don’t know what will come out of it.
There were a lot of crazy things going on.
The first thing I saw was this idea that their brandpersönlichekti has two separate but complementary sides – the Morgan Spurlock brand is an echtsame / playful brand.
They complement each other very well.
And I think there is almost a contradiction with it.
And I think some companies will only focus on one strength, rather than both.
Many companies tend – and that is human nature – to avoid things that they are not sure about, they will avoid fear, these elements, and that they welcome them, and they actually turn them for themselves into something positive, and that is a skillful chess trick.
Which other brands trade like this?
The first is a classic, Apple.
And you can also see it here, target, wii, mini of mini coopers and jetblue.
Well, there are playful brands and careful brands, these things that come and go, but a playful, careful brand is a pretty strong sache.
a careful, playful brand. what is your brand?
If someone asked her to describe her brand identity, her brand personality, what would she be?
Are you something that brings the blood in wallings?
Or are you more of a down-attribute?
Are you something that is a little quieter, more reserved, more conservative?
Up-attributes are things that are playful, fresh as the fresh prince, contemporary, adventurous, outspoken and sweet as erol flynn, wendig and agile, profane, herric, magical and mystical as gandalf.
Or are they more like a down-attribute?
Are you mindful and mindful like 007?
Are you established, traditional, caring, protective, mitfühlend like Oprah?
Are they reliable, stable, familiar, safe, safe, holy, thoughtful and wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
In the course of the films we had more than 500 companies, which were up and down companies and who said ‘no’ because they didn’t want to be part of the project.
They did not want to have anything to do with this film because they had no control, no control over the finished product.
But we will find 17 brand partners, who were willing to renounce this control, who wanted to do business with someone as mindful and playful as I was, and who eventually enabled us to tell stories that we would normally not have been able to tell – stories that a advertiser would normally never support.
They enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing, just as we tell the story in this film, that mris is used today to stimulate the lust centers of the brain, both for advertising and filmmaking.
We headed to Sao Paulo, where outdoor advertising is prohibited.
In the entire city there has been no advertisement board, no poster, no flyer, nothing for five years.
And we drove to school districts, where companies are paving their way in poor schools, all over America.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects of which I have received the most feedback or where I have had the greatest success are those where I interacted directly with things.
And that’s what these brands have done,
Because they bypassed the intermediary, they bypassed the agencies, and said that those agencies may not really have their interests in mind.
I will negotiate directly with the artist.
I will work with him and create something completely different, something that makes people think that our worldview is challenging.
What was it for you? what was it for you?
Now that the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, we can take a look at it.
According to Burrelles, the premiere was in January, and since then — and that’s not even the whole thing — there have been 900 million calls from this film.
This actually includes only a time period of 2 1/2 weeks.
This is only online — no press, no television.
The film has not yet been released.
It’s not even online yet, no streaming.
It has not yet appeared in other countries.
In the end, the film has achieved a very big momentum.
And that’s not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency we talked to has advised their customers to let go of it.
Something I firmly believe is that when you take your chance, you take the risk that opportunities are stuck in those risks.
I believe that if you keep people from doing so, you will bring them closer to failure.
I believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks, you prepare the entire company to make a profit.
I feel that as we move forward, we need to encourage people to take risks.
We need to encourage people not to be afraid of opportunities that may scare them.
Finally, as we move forward, we should welcome the fear.
We should put the bear in the cage.
Call the fear welcome; call the risk welcome.
Each full with a large spoonful, so we welcome the risk.
Finally, we should welcome transparency.
Today, more than before, brings us a bit of honesty very far.
And that said, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, you welcome transparency, was presented to you by my good friends of emc, who paid $7100 for the name rights on ebay.
Big data is being transformed into big opportunities for organizations around the world.
emc presented &quot; they are transparenz welcome &quot;;
Many thanks to you.
Now, Morgan, in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to the $7100?
That’s a great question.
I have in my pocket a check, issued to the superorganisation of the ted-organisation, the sapling-stiftung -- a check in the amount of $7,100, to finance my ted-appearance in the next year.
My name is Amit.
18 months ago I did something different at Google, and I decided to do something with museums and art. my boss, who is today, gave me the green light.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun lectures and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I will focus on the show.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal view is very simple with this folie and its access explained.
I grew up in India.
I received a great education – I did not complain – but I had too many museums and no access to these works of art.
As I then traveled and visited these museums, I began to learn a lot.
And while I was working for Google, I tried to combine this desire – to make art more accessible – with technology.
We then formed a team, a great crew, and we started here.
I will probably start with the demonstration, and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start.
Go to googleartproject.com.
You can see all these museums here.
There is the Uffizi, the Moma, the Hermitage, the Riks, the Van Gogh.
I even go to one of my favourites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
There are two ways to get in – very easy.
click, and wumms, you are in this museum.
It doesn’t matter where you are – Bombay, Mexico, it makes no difference.
You walk around and have fun.
Do you want to go to the museum?
Open the map, and jump it with a click.
Within you are, you want to end up with gangs.
Just go on. much fun.
Stumble on them.
Thank you, but the best is yet to come.
Now I am also in front of one of my favorite paintings, Erntearbeiter von Pieter Breugel in der Met.
I see this plus sign.
If the museum has given us the picture, click on it.
This is now one of the pictures.
Here are all the metadata.
Those of you who are really interested in art can click here – but I click it now.
This is one of the images that we have captured using the so-called gigapixel technology.
This image, for example, has about 10 billion picture points, I think.
And a lot of people ask me: &quot;What do you get for 10 billion picture points? &quot;
I’ll show you this now:
You can very easily in and outzoom.
You see something funny here.
I love this guy; his expression is invaluable.
But then you really want to go deep into it.
And so I started playing around, and realized that there was something going on there.
And I thought: &quot; for a moment, that sounds interesting. &quot;
I ran, and slowly noticed that these children were actually choking a bit.
I researched a little, spoke with some acquaintances at the meeting, and actually found out that it is a game called squail, in which a goat is beaten on a fastnight Tuesday with a stock.
It seems that war is quite popular.
I don’t know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
In order to go really near here, one can go to the pitch.
Just to give them the overview, I zoom out so they can see what you get.
Here we were, and this is the painting.
But the best thing still comes – in a second.
Let us quickly jump to Moma, back in New York.
Another favourite picture of me, the night of the stars.
In the previous example, it was necessary to find details.
But what if you see the stickers will?
And what if we see how Van Gogh created this masterpiece?
man zoomed hinein. you can really go in.
I will zoom into one of my favorite parts of this picture, until I am really at the rise.
It’s a starnight, I guess I’ve never seen it like that before.
Now I will show you my favourite function.
There are many more, but I lack that time.
That’s the really cool part, it’s called sammlungen.
Each of them, each – whether rich or poor, whether they have a big house – does not matter.
You can get started and create your own museum online – from all these images you can create your own collection.
Simply put, they go in – and I created this, it’s called the power of zoom – they can zoom around.
This is the messengers, in the national gallery.
You can give comments, send them to your friends, and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces.
I think, in conclusion, the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things here do not come from Google.
They don’t even come from those museums after my memory.
Maybe I shouldn’t say that.
They come from the artist.
And that was an experience in humility for me.
I mean, I hope that we will get along with this digital medium of art, and properly represent it online.
This is the biggest question that is asked to me recently: &quot;Did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum visit? &quot;;
The answer to that is no.
It should complement the experience.
It goes well. thank you.
Thank you thanks.
This is a representation of her brain; her brain can be divided into two halves.
This is the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive side.
If we had a scale to measure the appetite of each hemisphere, we could represent their brains.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is completely intuitive.
Now, where would you position your brain on this scale?
Some of us may have chosen one of these extremes, but I think that for most people in the audience, their brains look like this – with a high aptitude, which is simultaneously in both hemispheres.
It is not as though they are both exclusive or similar.
They can be logical and intuitive.
And so I see myself as one of those people, along with most other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good proportion of logic to put those complex ideas together.
But at the same time, we need a good ratio of intuition in order to actually perform those experiments.
How do we develop this intuition? well, we love to play with things.
So we go out and play with it, and then see how it reacts, and then we begin to develop our intuition there.
Basically, they do the same thing.
So one of the intuitions they have developed over the years is probably that a thing can only be in one place at the same time.
I mean, it may sound strange to think that one thing is at the same time in two different locations, but you were not born with that idea, you developed it.
I remember seeing a child playing on a bodenschwelle.
There was still a little boy and not very good at it and he was constantly falling there.
But I bet that playing with the bodenschwelle taught him a very valuable lesson, namely that the big things don’t just let you pass, and that they stay on a star.
And this is a great conceptual model of the world, as long as you are not a partial physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a part-physicist, because they are not playing with bodenschwellen, but with these little strange partchen.
And when you play with your parts, you capture all sorts of strange things—such as flying directly through the mausoleum, or being in two different places at the same time.
So they recorded all these observations, and called them the theory of quantum mechanics.
That was the state of physics a few years ago; quantum mechanics was needed to describe the small, tiny parts.
But they were not needed to describe the large everyday objects around us.
That didn’t like my intuition, and maybe only because I don’t play with parts so often.
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often.
And I haven’t seen you yet.
I mean, no one has ever seen a part.
But my logical side didn’t like it either.
For if all things are made up of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics, shouldn’t everything simply follow the rules of quantum mechanics?
I see no reason why this should not be the case.
I would also feel much better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago I decided to do exactly that.
I created one.
This is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical superposition war.
What we also looked at here is a winziger computer chip.
And you can’t see that green spot in there.
This is the piece of metal that I will talk about right away.
This is a picture of the object.
We look right here in the center.
And here is a really very big close-up of this small piece of metal.
So what we look at is a small piece of metal, it is like a springboard shaped and it stands over the edge.
I also did this thing in a similar way to making a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with new silicon discs, and rackerte for 100 hours on all the large devices.
For the last bit, I had to build my own machine – in order to get this swimming pool-shaped hole and that thing.
This thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition but it takes a little help to do it.
Let me give you an analogy.
Do you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator?
I mean, when I am alone in the elevator, then I do all sorts of strange things but then other people go up and I stop doing all these things because I don’t want to bother them with it, or, frankly, scare them.
Quantum mechanics also says that unmoving objects feel the same.
The drivers of immovable objects are not only humans, but also the light that shines on them and the wind that flies past them and the heat of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behaved quantum mechanically, we had to scratch all the fellow travellers out.
And then we did that.
We turned off the light, put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air and cooled it until now, all alone in the elevator, the piece of metal was free, to behave as it wanted.
So we measured his movement.
We notice that it really moves strangely.
Instead of just being quiet there, it vibrated. the way it vibrated was about the same as this here - like an expanding and together ziehender blasebalg.
By giving him a little push, we were able to make him vibrate and not vibrate at the same time – something that is only permitted in quantum mechanics.
What I just told you was also really fantastic.
What does it mean for an object to vibrate and not to vibrate at the same time?
Let us think about the atoms.
So the first case: all the trillions of atoms that make up the piece of metal lie still there and at the same time diesel atoms move up and down.
Only at precise times do they agree.
The rest of the time they are relocalized.
This means that each atom is at two different locations at the same time, which at the same time means that the entire piece of metal is at two different locations.
I think that’s really cool.
Really really.
It was worthwhile to include me in the clean space for all these years because, check that, the difference in mass between a single atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them.
So if a single atom can be at two different locations at the same time, this piece of metal can be at two different locations, then why not they too?
I mean, that’s just what my logical side says.
So imagine, if you were at several locations at the same time, how would that feel?
How would your consciousness cope with the fact that your body is delocalized in space?
There is another aspect of history.
As we warm it up, turn on the light and look back at the coffin, we saw that the piece of metal was always in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are in reality just quantum objects that are folded together in a small space.
They hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected with everything.
Well, that’s not exactly right;
There is more behind it, it goes even deeper.
It is true that these connections, their connections with all the things around them, literally define who they are, and that is the deep and strange thing about quantum mechanics.
Many thanks.
In 2007, I decided that we should reconceptualize how we think about economic development.
It should be our soul that when families think about where they want to live and work, they are given the opportunity to choose from at least one hand full of different cities, all in competition for new inhabitants.
At the moment, we are far away from this soul.
There are billions of people in developing countries who do not even have a single city available to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth so much more than it costs to build them.
We could also very easily equip the world with dozens,<unk> even hundreds of new cities.
This may sound absurd to you now, as long as you have never thought about new cities before.
Just exchange the smell of housing for the smell of cities.
Imagine, half of the people who want to live in apartments are already doing this; the other half is not yet.
They could try to expand the capacity of existing houses.
But they know what they would do, in these apartments and their surroundings, laws prevail to avoid complaints and abuse.
It is therefore very difficult to meet all these extensions.
But one could go to an entirely new place, build an entirely new living block, provided that the laws there would support such a smell and not hinder it.
I have also suggested that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and have given them a name: charter cities.
Later I found out that, about the same time, Javier and Octavio thought about the challenge of a reform in Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 Hondurans leave their country to emigrate to the United States, and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and can do exactly the same in Honduras.
On this occasion, Javier told Octavio, “What happens if we take an uninhabited area of our country—what if we simply give it to an embassy—a part of the American embassy; a part of the Canadian embassy—and if the people then want to work under the Canadian rules or those of the United States, can they work there, and can do anything on the surface of these embassies, for which they normally have to go to Canada or America?”
In the summer of 2009, Honduras suffered a severe constitutional crisis.
At the next planned election, Pepe Lobo won in a change whose program promised both neuerungen and schlichtung.
Er demanded that Octavio become his chief of staff.
In the meantime, I was preparing for a lecture at Tedglobal.
By improving, testing and studying consumers, I have tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to the essential elements.
The first point, is the importance of laws, laws, which stipulate that one cannot disturb existing housing owners.
We pay great attention to new technologies, but for progress it requires technology and laws, and it is usually laws that hold us back.
In autumn 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio the link to them Tedtalk.
Then he showed him Javier.
Both of them called me.
And they said, "Let's present this to the presidents of our country!" &quot;
So we meet in December in the seat of a hotel in Miami.
I have tried to make it clear how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are when they cost.
And I used this chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like New York. remember that in some cases, an area per square meter is worth thousands of dollars.
But it was a rather abstract discussion, and if there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, we might have a look at the Tedtalk."
Tedtalk also stated in a very simple form that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited land, a founding treaty that sets out the laws that rule there and gives people the opportunity to decide whether to live under these rules or not.
That is why I was asked by the President of Honduras, who said that we need to realize this project, that it is important, and that this is the way to move our country forward.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and again to give a lecture on the fourth and fifth of January.
So I gave another fact-filled lecture, which included a graph like this one, trying to clarify that if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it must be a very large city.
This is a picture of the city of Denver, and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in Denver.
This airport alone has an area of 100 square kilometers.
I have also tried to convince the Honduran people that if you want to build a new city, you have to start with an area of at least 1000 square kilometers.
That’s more than 250 thousand tomorrow.
Everyone applauded courteously.
The faces of the spectators were very serious and attentive.
The head of Congress came on stage and said, "Professor Romer, I thank you very much for your speech, but maybe we could watch the Tedtalk.
I have it here on my laptop. &quot;
I also sat down, and you played off the tedtalk.
And I have come to the core statement that a new city offers new opportunities to mankind.
There would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of kilometers away in the north.
And a new city also opens up new opportunities for leaders.
The leaders of the government in Honduras would rely on the help of partner countries, they could benefit from their partner countries, who would assist them in drafting the laws for this charter and in implementing that everyone can trust that the charter is truly enforced.
And the recognition of President Lobo was that the certainty of enforcement that I have thought of as a way to get foreign investors to come here and build this city could be equally significant for all parties in Honduras, which have suffered from fear and distrust for many years.
We are driving in a danger area.
This picture is from this place.
It can easily reach a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly thereafter, on 19 January, they voted in the Congress for an amendment to the Constitution in order to have a constitutional regulation that is permissible for special areas of development.
In a country that is now experiencing a severe crisis, Congress voted in favour of this constitutional amendment with 124 votes to one vote.
All parties, all factions of society, supported this.
But in order to become part of the Constitution, it must be approved twice by Congress.
On 17 February, it was approved for the second time with 114 votes to one vote.
Immediately after this election, between 21 and 24 February, a delegation of approximately 30 hunduraners travelled to the two places of the world that were most interested in getting involved in the business of urban construction.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a large, new city centre that was built in South Korea – larger than the city centre of Boston.
Everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to obtain the approvals.
The other place that was very interested in urban development is Singapore.
Two cities have already been built in China and the third is in preparation.
So if you think about it from a practical point of view, this is where we stand today.
They already have a building ground; and they are already considering this area for the second city.
There is already work on a legal system that allows managers to participate, and there is also work on an external legal system.
A country has already offered to make its Supreme Court available as a court for the unjustifiable functioning of that judicial system.
Urban designers and builders are also very interested.
They even bring funding with them.
One thing, as you already know, has already been solved, there are a lot of myters.
There are many<unk> that would like to settle in America, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are many people who would like to live there.
There are 700 million people worldwide who indicate that they would like to live permanently in another place.
One million people leave Latin America every year and migrate to the United States from.
Many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to find work—sometimes they are single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothes.
Unfortunately, it is sometimes even children who try to find their parents, whom they have, in some cases, not seen for a decade.
So what is it like to think about building an entirely new city in Honduras?
Or even to build dozens of these cities, or hundreds scattered around the world?
So what is the idea of insisting that each family has a choice between several cities in competition for new inhabitants?
This is an idea that is worth spreading.
My friends from Honduras have asked me to say, thank you Ted.
Do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day?
Do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week?
I recently conducted a survey of more than 2,000 Americans and the average number of decisions a typical American makes on a single tag is 70.
There was also a recent study with CEOs, in which they observed CEOs for a week.
And these scientists have simply documented the various topics that these CEOs have dealt with, and how much time they have spent making decisions related to those topics.
And they found that an average CEO deals with 139 tasks a week.
Each of these themes, of course, consisted of many, many smaller decisions.
50% of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own decisions.
Do you know how many decisions you make in the nine-minute category versus the one-hour category?
How well do you think you are able to handle these decisions?
Today I would like to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time, the decision overload problem.
I would like to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
Now, when I talk about this problem, I will ask you a few questions and I would like to know your answers.
When I ask you a question, as I am blind, just raise the hand if you want to burn a few calories.
Otherwise, if I ask you a question, and your answer is yes, then my first question for today is: are you ready to hear something about the decision overload problem?
Many thanks.
When I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I went to this very exclusive livensmittelladen; at least then war is really exclusive.
it was a laden, der draeger &apos; s hieß.
This business, it was almost like an amusement park.
They had 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar and over 500 different kinds of oysters and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of wasser – and that was at a time when we actually drank leitungswasser.
I loved going to this store; but at one point I wondered, well, why is it that you don’t buy anything?
Here is the olive oil corridor.
They had over 75 different varieties of olive oil, including those that were included in cages that came from thousands of years old olive trees.
So I decided one day to visit the branch manager, and I asked the manager, &quot;Does this model really work that they offer all these possibilities to mankind? &quot;
And he pointed to the bus loads of tourists, who came every day and usually had their cameras with them.
We decided to undertake an experiment and we chose marmelade for our experiment.
Here is her marmelade walk.
They had 348 different kinds of marmelade.
We have set up a small service corner directly at the entrance of the store.
We put six different flavors of marmelade or 24 different flavors of marmelade there, and we looked at two things: firstly, in which case would more people stay and try marmelade?
There are more people standing when they were 24, about 60 percent, than when they were six, about 40 percent.
And then we looked at each other in which case people would rather buy a glass of marmelade.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stayed standing when they were 24, only three percent actually bought a glass of jam.
Of the people who stood when they were six, now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of jam.
Now, when they calculate it, people would buy six times more for a glass of jam, who had six to choose from, than if they had 24 to choose from.
Now, deciding not to buy a glass of jam is probably good for us — at least it is good for our height — but it turns out that the decision overload problem affects us even in very consistent decisions.
We choose not to decide, even if it goes against our own best interests.
Then on to the topic of the tags: financial savings.
I will now describe a study that I conducted with gur huberman, emir kamenica, wei jang, in which we examined the decisions to save plans for the income of almost one million Americans from approximately 650 plans across the United States.
And what we thought about was whether the number of fund offers, which were possible for an interest savings plan, the 401 plan, which affects the probability of whether more will be saved for tomorrow.
And we found out that there was indeed a connection.
So in these plans, we had approximately 657 plans that offer the person something between two to 59 different funds.
And what we found out was that the more funds were offered, that, in fact, the participation rate was lower.
If you now look at the extremes, the plans offered by the two funds had a participation rate in the siebzigern – still not as high as we would like it.
In the plans, which offer almost 60 funds, the participation rate now fell to about sixty-six percent.
Now it turns out that even if they decide to participate, if more options are available, even then, it has negative consequences.
Thus, the people who decided to participate tended more to the fact that the more options they had, the more they avoided choosing stocks and funds.
The more options they have at their disposal, the more likely they are to put their entire money in reine geldmarkt accounts.
None of these extreme decisions are one of the decisions someone would recommend if their future financial well-being is important to us.
Now, over the past ten years, we have observed three major negative consequences for humans, which the offering of more and more choices brings with it.
They push the decision – they push it up, even if it is against their own best interests.
They are more likely to make worse decisions – worse financial and worse medical decisions.
They are more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even if they do it objectively better.
The main reason for this is that we may enjoy looking at this huge regale full of mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar and marmelade, but we can not actually draw the comparisons and limitations and then actually choose something from the fantastic offer.
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques – techniques that we have tested in different ways and in different areas of research – that you can easily apply in your business.
First of all, it is limited.
You’ve heard it before, but it was never more true than today that less is more.
The people are always worried when I say, &quot;limited. &quot;
They are always worried that they will lose their royal surface.
But in truth, we see it more and more that if they are willing to limit themselves, and the unimportant similar possibilities become free, well, then there is an increase in sales, there is a reduction in costs, &amp; amp; and there is an improvement in decision-making.
As proctor and gamble who reduced different head and shoulder species from 26 to 15, they experienced an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 am worst-selling catzenstreus, they experienced that the profits increased by 87 percent – a result of both the increase in sales and the reduction in costs.
You know, the average supermarket today offers you 45,000 products.
A typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the ninth-largest supermarket, which is now the ninth-largest supermarket in the world, is Aldi, and they offer them only 1,400 products – a kind of tomato sauce in canes.
Now in the world of savings, I think one of the best examples that have recently come to the market, about how to best manage the choices, was something that David Laibson has very strongly contributed to, it is a program that is offered at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employee now automatically participates in a lifetime fund.
Those who really want to make a selection are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more funds.
You know, as people often say, &quot;I don't know how to limit it.
These are all important possibilities. &quot;
And the first thing I ask the employees is, “Tell me how these options differ from each other.”
And if your employees can’t keep you apart, your customers can’t.
Now, before we started lunch today, I had a conversation with Gary.
And Gary said he would be willing to offer all the people in this crowd a all-inclusive paid vacation on the most beautiful street in the world.
Here is a description of the street.
I want you to like to read it.
And now I give you a few seconds to read it and then I ask you to chat if you are ready to accept Gary’s offer.
Everyone is ready, Gary’s offer is anzunehmen.
Are they all?
Well, let me show you a little more of it.
You know, it was a trick in it, wasn’t it?
Now, who is ready for this journey?
I think I’ve probably heard more hands.
Well well.
The fact is, objectively speaking, they had more information the first time than the second time, but I would dare to guess that they felt it more realistic the second time.
Because the pictures make it feel more real for you.
What brings me to the second technique, which helps you deal with the problem of decision overload, is the concretization.
It is about that people, in order to understand the difference between possibilities, must understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities, and that these consequences must be felt vividly and concretely.
Why do people spend on average 15 to 30 percent more when they use an EC card or a credit card than when they use cash?
Because we don’t feel like real money.
And it turns out that when one manages to make something feel concrete, it is a very good tool to make people save more.
So in a study I did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero, we did a study with the people at ing -- employees who all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a meeting where they registered their participation in their retirement savings plan.
And during this gathering, we left this gathering exactly as it always was, only adding a little bit.
The little thing we added was that we asked those people to simply think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were to save money.
When we did this simple thing, there was a 20% increase in participation and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or a 4% increase in the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account.
The third technique: categorization.
We can better deal with more categories than with more choices.
Here is, for example, a study that we did in a journal.
It turns out that in the wegmans supermarkets up and down in the northeast region, the number ranges from 331 different types of newspapers to up to 664 newspapers.
But do you know what?
If I show them 600 magazines and divide them into 10 categories, or I show them 400 magazines and divide them into 20 categories, then they will think that I have given them more selection and a better selection experience than I would have given them the 400 compared to them if I had given them the 600.
For those categories tell me how to keep them apart.
Here are two different jewelry designs.
One is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing &quot; .
If you think that the left advertisement is swing and the right advertisement is jazz, then knock in the hands.
OK, there are a couple.
If you think that the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, then please chat.
Okay, a few more.
Now, it turns out that you are right.
The one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, but do you know what?
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.
The categories have to say something to the voter, not to the one who provides the selection.
And you often see this problem when you look at the long list of all these funds.
Whom do you want to inform with this?
My fourth technique is the prerequisite for complexity.
It turns out that in fact we can handle more information than we think, we just have to simplify it.
We need to slowly increase the complexity.
I’ll give you an example of what I mean.
Let us make a very, very complicated decision: the purchase of a car.
Here is a German car manufacturer, which offers you the opportunity to configure your car completely yourself.
You have to make 62 different decisions in order to design your car completely.
Now these decisions differ in the number of options they offer for decision making.
Car colour, car colour – I have 56 options.
engine, transmission – four possibilities.
What I do now is change the order in which the decisions appear.
Half of the customer goes from the many possibilities, 56 car colors to the little possibilities, four gearboards.
The other half of the customer goes from the few possibilities, four gearboards, to the 56 car colors, many possibilities.
What am I looking at?
How interested you are.
If they constantly use the standard choice when deciding, it means that they are overwhelmed, that is, I lose them.
What they find out is that the people who go from the many to the few options choose the standard choice over and over again.
We will lose them.
Go from the few options to the many, then stay with them.
It is the same number of possibilities.
The only thing I have done is to change the order in which this information is presented.
When I start with the simple, I learn how to choose.
Even though the getriebe is chosen, nothing about my preferences at the innenausstattung says to me, it still prepares me to choose.
It also makes me excited about the great product I’m putting together, and so I’m willing to be motivated to be involved with interest.
Let me summarize.
I have told you about four techniques that mitigate the problem of decision overload – limit – you will loose the superfluous alternatives; concretize – make it real; categorize – we can better bypass with more categories, fewer opportunities; prepare for complexity.
Each of these techniques I describe to you today is intended to help you manage those opportunities – good for you, you can use them for yourself, good for the people you serve.
I believe that the key to making the best choice is to be selective.
And the more selective we are in choosing, the better we will be able to practice the art of making decisions.
Many thanks.
Hi, I am Kevin Allocca, trends manager at youtube.
That is true.
Today we want to talk about how videos become viral, and then why this is important at all.
We all want to be stars - celebrities, singers, comedians - if I jung war, it seems so endlessly difficult.
But web videos have enabled us to make all or all of our creative activities crazyly famous in some part of the culture of our world.
Every one of you could be famous on the Internet until next Saturday.
But at YouTube, more than 48 hours of video are uploaded per minute.
Again, only a tiny percentage of them will ever become viral and will be viewed by thousands of men and so to the cultural moment.
So how does that work?
Three things: tastemaker, participation communities and the unexpected.
Well, then we want to mal.
Oh my God, oh my God.
Oh my God!
Woah! woah!
Ohhhhh, wowwww!
Last year you sent Bear Vasquez this video, which was filmed in the Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, 23 million people were missed.
This graph shows what it looked like when the video first became popular last summer.
In fact, Bear did not want to make a viral video.
He just wanted to share a rainbow.
It’s because you do that when you’re called Yosemite mountain bear.
There were a lot of natural videos uploaded.
And this video was actually already posted in January.
What has happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel is here.
Jimmy Kimmel posted the tweet that made the video so popular at the end of the day.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and show them to a large audience.
it's Friday, Friday. gotta get down on Friday. everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. gettin' down on Friday. you<unk>'t have thought we would have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca Blacks &quot;Friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the years.
This year, it was almost 200 million times viewed.
I saw the graphic out.
Exactly as with &quot;double rainbow &quot; it seems to have come out of nothing.
What happened on that day?
Well, it was Friday, that is true.
If you want to know: these other spits are also freitage.
But what about this day, this particular Friday?
Well, tosh.0 gabeled it up, many blogs seem to write about it.
Michael J. Nelson from the mystery science theater was one of the first to make a joke about it on Twitter.
It is important that an individual or a group of tastemakers share a point of view with a large audience and thus accelerate the process.
Then this community of people who shared this great insider joke formed, and began to talk about it and thus play out.
There are now 10,000 parodies of &quot;friday &quot; on YouTube.
Already in the first seven days there was a parody for each single weekend.
Unlike in the unilateral conversation of the 20th century, the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon – either by spreading it or by making something new out of it.
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endlosschleife .
That’s it, very simply.
This year, it was almost 50 million times viewed.
And if you think this is crazy, you should know that there is a three-hour version of it, which has been viewed four million times.
Even cats are watching this video.
Cats are watching cats who are watching this video.
Important is the creativity that prevails in the Internet culture of techies and geeks.
There was a remix.
Someone made an old-fashioned version of it.
And then it became international.
A whole remix-community shot from the bottom, which turned it from a stupid joke into something in which we all can participate.
Today we don’t just find genus on something, we do it with.
Who could have predicted all this?
Who could have predicted &quot;double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;nyan cat &quot;?
Which draft books could you have written in which such drinks were contained?
In a world where 2 days of video material is uploaded every minute, only truly unique and unexpected things like the mentioned videos can emerge.
I admit, I was not<unk> interested, when a friend told me, I let me see this great video, about a guy who is protesting in New York against the strafzettel for fahrräder.
I get a penalty card because I am not on the cycling road, but often there are disabilities that make one not drive decently on the cycling road.
Because it was completely surprising and humorous, Casey Niestats funny idea and his argument were viewed 5 million times.
This approach applies to everything new that we do creatively.
And all this leads us to one big question...
What does this mean?
Ohhhhhh .
What does this mean?
tastemakers, creative participant communities, completely unexpected, are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture, to which everyone has access and in which the audience determines popularity.
As I said, one of the biggest stars currently – Justin Bieber – made his beginnings on YouTube.
No one has to give your idea the green light.
And today we all feel as owners of our pop culture.
And these are not the characteristics of the old media and they hardly meet today’s media, but they will determine the entertainment of the future.
Many thanks.
How can I talk in ten minutes about the connection between women over three generations, and how the astonishing strength of this connection was manifested in the life of a four-year-old girl, when more than 30 years ago she sat together with her little sister, mother and grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the Chinese lake, a connection that fested itself in the life of this little girl and never disappeared – this little girl who now lives in San Francisco and today speaks before them?
The story is not over yet.
It is a puzzle that is still being assembled.
I want to tell you about some of the puzzles.
Imagine the first piece: a man who burns his life’s work.
He is a poet, a writer, a man whose whole life has been held together by the simple hope of the unity and freedom of his homeland.
They keep him in front of the communist invasion of Saigon, as he must admit that his life had been a mere waste.
Those words, as long as his friends, spotted him now.
He moved back into the silence.
is dead, broken by that history.
This is my grandfather.
I have not known him personally.
But our lives are so much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
I had to make sure it wasn’t in vain, and it was my job to learn that history was trying to crush us, but we survived it.
The next piece of the puzzle shows how a boot in the early morning lease on see expires.
My mother was 18, when her father died – already in an arranged marriage, already with two little girls.
For her, life had set her a task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was completely excluded that she could fail.
After a four-year-old and film tyres saga, a boat still glitt on the sea, as a fisherman boat getarnt.
All adults were aware of the risks.
They were most afraid of pirates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boot, my mother carried a small gift bottle with her.
When I was captured, my sister and I, then she and my grandmother, would have drank from it.
My first memories are of this boot – the steady tuckern of the motors, the knocking of a single wave on the bug, the wide and empty horizon.
I do not remember the pirates who came many times, but were deceived by the sadness of the men on our boat, or by the failure of the engine, which did not start for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform off the Malaysian coast, and the young man who collapsed and died that the end of the journey was too much for him, and the taste of the first apple that one of the men on the platform gave me.
No apple has ever tasted so good again.
After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
And the next puzzle is about four women in three generations, who are building a new life together.
We left ourselves in footscray down, a working-class inhabitant of the outskirts, whose population consists of immigrant schichten.
Unlike in the old middle class, whose existence was completely unknown to me, there was no anspruchsdenken in footscray.
The smell of the doors came from the rest of the world.
And the cracks of broken English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common: they started new.
My mother worked on a farm, then on a fließband in an automotive factory, six days, double schichten.
Somehow she managed to find the time to acquire English and IT skills.
We were poor.
Each dollar was allocated and invested in further training in English and mathematics, no matter what versions we had for this. mostly the new thing, which always came second-hand.
Two pairs of socks for the school, each to cover the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the knees, because she had to reach six years.
And there were the rare but painful choirs of “schlitzauge” and here and there wall paintings: “Asian, go home.”
Home Where to go?
Something has broken up in me.
There was a meeting for reconciliation and a quiet voice said: “I will go away from your way.”
My mother, my sister and I were sleeping in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we told each other about our day, and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother, a little nightmare from the boat.
And it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightmares came, so that I could wake them up.
She opened a computer store, then completed a cosmetic training and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not endure the change, angry and unflexible, and sorrowful children, trapped between two worlds.
Lenders and sponsors were sought.
The centers were built.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classical Asian student, who made unremitting demands on himself.
In others, I was involved in uncertain lives, the tragic scourges of violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But so many have received help over the years.
And because of this help, in my last year of law studies, I was elected as a young Australian of years.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the puzzle to the next, and the strips didn’t fit together.
Tan le, an anonymous resident of Footscray, was now a refugee and social activist who was invited to appear in places she had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she could never have imagined.
I was not familiar with the label.
I didn’t know how to use the stick.
I didn’t know how to talk about wine.
I didn’t know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to return to the routine and convenience of life in an unknown suburb – a grandmother, a mother and two daughters, each of whom had their days as complete as they had been for twenty years, telling each other the stories of their day and falling asleep, we three still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn’t do that.
She reminded me that I was as old as you were when we climbed the boat.
No war was never an option.
“You are simply,” she said, “and don’t be what you are not.”
So I spoke about youth unemployment and education, and the neglect of the marginalized and entrechtites.
And the more offensive I spoke, the more I should tell.
I met people in all lifetimes, so many of them did what they loved, lived on the limits of the possible.
And even though I had my degree, I realized that I could not meet myself with a career in law.
There must have been another puzzle.
And at the same time I realized that it’s okay to be an outsider, a newcomer, a new im image – and not only okay, but something to be grateful for, maybe a gift of boots.
Because belonging to it can so easily lead to the collapse of the horizon, it can so easily mean accepting the assumptions of the environment.
I have now gone out of my comfort zone enough to know that, yes, the world breaks apart, but not as one fears.
Opportunities that would not have been allowed were explicitly encouraged.
There was an energy, an unwavering optimism, a strange mixture of humility and vanity.
So I followed my bauch feeling.
I gathered a small team of people around me, for whom the schublade "it's not going" represented an irresistible challenge.
For a year, we didn’t have a single cent.
One day, I cooked a huge soup that we shared.
We worked until late that night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but there were a few brilliant in it, and we made the breakthrough.
I made the decision to move to the United States,
After just one trip there.
My feelings again.
Three months later I moved and the adventure continued.
Before I conclude, I want to tell you about my grandmother.
It grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the most important person.
Life hasn’t changed for hundreds of years.
Her father died shortly after her birth.
Her mother took her up by herself.
At the age of 17, she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother she slaughtered.
Without the support of her husband, she caused a sensation by bringing him to court and being the prosecutor in her own case, and an even greater sensation, when she won.
&quot; does not &quot;erve itself as untrue.
I was just taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney, 1000 km away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she was here to say goodbye.
My mother called me a few minutes later.
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in footcray and sat around her guard.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight, the monk came and said he had to close the guard.
My mother beat us, touching her hand.
She asked the monk: "Why is her hand so warm and the rest of her so cold?"
&quot; because they have been holding them since this morning &quot;, he said.
&quot;they didn’t let them go. &quot;
If there is a band in our family, it goes through the women.
If we see who we were and how life has shaped us, we can now see that the men who may have come into our lives have come to us.
The defeat would have been too easy.
Now I want to have my own children, and I still think of the boat.
Who would ever wish for one?
Yes, I am afraid of privileges, of ease, of justifications.
Can I give you a bug in your life that courageously challenges everyone, the unbeirrte, the steady tuckern of motors, the wide horizon where nothing is guaranteed?
I do not know.
But if I could give this and safely pass it through, I would do it.
In addition, tans mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row.
I am here to share my photos with you.
Is it a photograph at all?
This is, of course, a picture that you can’t capture with your camera.
Nevertheless, my interest in photography began when I received my first digital camera, at the turn of 15 years.
I combined it with my previous preference for drawing, but it was a bit different, because when using the camera, the process was rather in the planning.
And when you take a picture with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.
For me, photography also seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time.
I thought everybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something else, something in which the process starts when the trigger is pressed.
photos like this: a baustelle along a busy street.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And still keep a realistic level.
or photos like this – dark and colorful at the same time, but all with the common soul, to maintain a realistic plane.
When I mean reality, I mean photo-reality.
Because, of course, it is not something that can really be captured, but I always want to make it look like it could have been on a photo.
Photos, where one has to think for a moment in order to find out the trick.
So it’s more about capturing an idea than really a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look realistic?
Is it about the details or the colors?
Is it about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
Ultimately, however, it is about how we interpret the world, and how it can be made tangible on a two-dimensional surface.
The question is not what is realistic, but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a reality puzzle in which different pieces can be taken and assembled to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
We have here three perfectly conceivable physical objects, with which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world.
But in a certain way combined with each other, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, as if it could exist.
But at the same time, we know that this is not possible.
So we overlook our brains, because our brains simply don’t accept that it doesn’t really make sense.
And I see the same process in combining photos.
It’s really just about combining different realities.
So the things that make a picture look realistic, I believe, are the things we don’t think about, the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine photos, it is really important to think about them, because otherwise they just look somehow false.
I would also say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to<unk> a realistic result.
As you can see, these are not three special pictures.
combined, but you can create something special like this here.
The first rule, therefore, is that combined photos should have a diesel perspective.
Secondly, combined photos should have diesel lighting.
And these two images meet these two requirements – shot from the same height and the same type of lighting.
Drittens is about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images begin and end by seamlessly connecting them.
This makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually assembled.
Thus, by adding color, contrast and brightness at the edges of each image, photographic gaps, such as field depth, unsaturated colors and disturbances, we blur the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo, although an image can basically contain hundreds of planes.
Here is another example.
One may think that this is just a landscape, and that the bottom part has been manipulated.
But in reality, this image is composed entirely of photos from different locations.
I personally think that it is easier to create a place than to find a place, because you do not have to compromise with the idea in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And when I had this idea in the winter, I knew that I needed several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzles.
For example, the fish was taken on a fishing excursion.
The ufer comes from another place.
The underwater part comes from a rock breakdown.
And yes, I even red-colored the house on top of the island to make it look more Swedish.
In order to<unk> a realistic outcome, it goes from my perspective also beyond planning.
I always start with a sketch, an idea.
The following is about the combination of the different images.
And here every piece is very well planted.
And if you then make good shots, the result can be pretty beautiful, and also quite realistic.
All tools are therefore available, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Many thanks.
I would like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail.
And I think the most important point here is that we have stopped talking to our patients.
And one of the things we introduced at Radboud University was to place a head listener.
In doing so, she does not seem very scientific – she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients, family, relatives, &quot;how is it?
How can we help you? &quot;
And we think, we want to think, that this is one of the main problems, why all –<unk> only most of the electronic health projects – fail: because we have stopped listening.
This is my wlan-waage. a very simple thing.
She has a button, an out.
And one morning I’ll jump on it.
And yes, I have a task, as you may recognize.
I have set my task at 95 kg.
It works very simply: every time I jump on the scale, it also sends my data to Google Health.
And there they are also called by my general practitioner so that he can see where my weight problem lies, and not only at the moment when I need cardiological support or so, but also with a look into the past.
But there is something else.
Maybe you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So one morning I jump on my wlan-waage and the people are already talking to me before I sit in the car: &quot;Better just a small salad for lunch today, lucien. &quot;
But this is the coolest thing that can happen, because this is the groupzwang, groupzwang, to help patients, because this could be used against obesity, or it could get patients away from smoking.
But it could also be used to pull people out of their chairs, and get them to play some art game together, in order to better control their health.
This will be on the market next week.
There will be this small blood pressure messenger that you connect to an iPhone or so.
And it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home, send it to their doctor and share it with others, for example, for just over $100.
At this point, the patients come into play. they can not only regain control, be the captain on their own ship, but can also help us with health care in the face of the challenges ahead, as well as the explosion of health care costs, double demand, and so on.
make methods that are easy to use and catch them with this year to embrace patients in the team.
And you can<unk> this through such methods, but also through crowdsourcing.
And one of the things we did, I would like to share with you through a video course.
We have all the navigation systems in our cars.
Maybe even in our cell phones.
We know exactly where all Maastricht ATMs are located.
We know one more thing, where all the tanks are located.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where would the next aed be to help this patient?
We asked around, and nobody knew.
No one knew where the next life-saving aed was to be found at that moment.
We have carried out crowdsourcing in the Netherlands.
We built a website and asked a crowd, “If you see an ed, please tell us where it is, when it is on, because sometimes it is closed during business hours, of course.
More than 10,000 AEDs have already been<unk> in the Netherlands.
The next step was to find the apps for it.
And we designed an iPad app.
We have developed an app for screens, augmented reality, to find these aeds.
And if you are in a city like Maastricht and someone crashes, you can use your iPhone, and within the next few weeks also your Microsoft phone, to find the next aed that can save lives.
And today we want to introduce this not only as aed4u, as the product calls itself, but also as aed4us.
And we want to bring this to a global level.
And we ask our colleagues all over the world, from other universities, to help us behave like nodes in order to crowdsource these aeds around the world.
And if you’re on vacation and someone crashes, whether it’s your own family or someone else, you can find such an aed.
The other thing we would like to ask for is that companies around the world help us confirm these aeds.
These could be courier services, or a technician, for example, only to ensure that the notified AED is still at his disposal.
Please help us with this and try not only to improve the health, but to take it in hand.
Many thanks.
Today I am going to report unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup wants us to force ourselves toward environmental protection by ...
Crowdsourcing takes care of it.
Here is a video of what we are doing.
For a moment.
It may take time until it is loaded.
Well, we can just skip it – I’ll just skip the video instead.
No to no.
This is not...
Okay okay.
Solar technology is...
Oh, is my time over?
Okay, thank you very much.
So a few years ago I launched a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that represents pretty much everything they actually hate, we let them work in the government.
This program is called “Code for America” and it’s a bit like the friedenscorps for computer freaks.
Each year we select a few fellows and we let them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them to the third world, we send them to council houses.
And there they developed great apps, worked with urban co-workers.
But what they really do is show what is possible today with technology.
Let’s meet Al.
Al is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it looks like if he is looking for a date, but what he is really looking for is someone who freeschaufelt him when he is snowy because he knows he is not very good in the fire fighting when he is covered by a meter of snow.
How is it possible to seek help in this particular way?
Last year we had a team of fellows in Boston in the wake of the "code for America" programs.
They were there in February, and there was a lot of snow last February.
And they noticed that the city did not free these hydrants.
But a certain fellow, a man named erik michaels-ober, noticed something else, and that was that the inhabitants were swinging the bürgersteige freely, right in front of these sections.
So, what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It’s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydranten.
You agree to freely swing with him when it’s snowing.
If you can, you can give him a name, and he named the first one.
If you can’t, someone can take it away from you.
So there is a net little game dynamics.
This is a modest little app.
It is probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote in the past year.
But it does something, which was no other government technology tut.
It spreads rapidly out.
This guy in the I.T. department of the city of Honolulu has seen that he could use this app, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt tsunami siren.
It is very important that these tsunami sirens work, but the people steal the batteries.
So it’s up to the citizen to check them out.
And then Seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the clogged goldys.
And Chicago has just introduced them, so that the people can free the boulevard when it’s snowing.
We now know nine cities that plan to use this app.
And it has spread smoothly, organically, of course.
If you know something about government technology, you know that it doesn’t normally work that way.
The procurement of software usually takes a few years.
We had a team last year working on a project in Boston, for which three people took two and a half months.
It was a method for parents to find out which public schools are the right for their children.
We were later told that if it went over the normal channels, it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars.
And that is nothing yet.
There is currently a project in California justice that has so far cost taxpayers $2 billion, and it does not work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app, which is written in a few tags, and then spreads from itself, is a kind of shot against the bug on the institution of government.
It shows how the government could work better—not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
Not even as a tech company, but rather as the Internet itself.
And that means free access, which means open and productive.
And that is important.
But what is more important about this app is that it represents a new generation, which addresses the problem of government – not as the problem of a broken institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And this is a very good news, because it turns out that we are very good at collective trading with digital technology.
Now there is a large community of people who are restoring the tools we need to effectively pack things together.
It’s not just code for America’s fellows, there are hundreds of people across the country who rise up and write government apps, one tag in their own communities.
They have not given up on the government.
They are terribly frustrated with it, but they do not complain about it, they fix it.
And these people know something that we have lost out of sight.
And that’s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things we’re really upset about, is government, in the core, in the words of Tim O’Reilly, “what we do together that we can’t do alone.”
Today, a lot of people have given up the government.
And if you are one of those people, I ask you to think about it, because things are changing.
The policy does not change; the government is changing.
And because the government ultimately draws its power out of us – remember, “we the people?” – how we think about it will influence how this change takes place.
I didn’t know much about government when I started this program.
And like many people, I thought that with the government it is mainly about voting people in an office.
Now, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that it is primarily in the municipality, about beutelratten.
This is the call center for service and information.
There you usually get out when you call 311 in deiner stadt.
If you ever have the chance to work in your city call center, like our fellow Scott Silverman as part of the program -- in fact, do it all -- you will see that the people who call the government for many different problems, including that a beutelratte is stuck in their house.
Scott also gets this amfiteater.
is tipt &quot;beutelratte &quot; in the official datenbank .
And he doesn’t really have an idea. he starts with the catcher.
And finally he says, “Look, can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the animal is off?”
Applause for Scott.
But that was not the end of the pocket rats.
Boston doesn’t just have a call center.
It has an app, a web and mobile app, named &quot;citizens connect &quot;.
We didn’t write this app.
That’s the work very clever people do in the office of the &quot;new urban mechanics &quot; in Boston.
One tag -- that's an actual report -- kam dies rein: &quot;beutelratte in my mülltonne. can't say if she's dead.
How do I get them away? &quot;
but was with &quot;citizens connect &quot; happened is different.
Scott talked from mensch to mensch.
But on &quot;citizens connect&quot; everything is public, so everyone can see it.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next record we got was, “I went over there and found the garbage dump behind the house.
Beutelratte? yes. alive? do.
He turned the rubbish on the side. he went home.
Good night, sweet beutelratte. &quot;
Quite simple.
This is where the digital meets the physical.
And it’s also a good example of how the government gets into the crowdsourcing.
But it is also a great example of the government as a platform.
And I don’t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here.
I am talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
A citizen is half a citizen, but the government played a central role here.
It connects these two people.
And you could have connected them with government services if they were needed, but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps the other, we strengthen our communities.
If we call the catcher, it will cost a lot of money.
One of the most important things we need to remember is that government is not the same as politics.
And most people understand this, but they believe that one is the input of the other.
That our contribution to the system is to choose.
How many times have we elected a political leader — and sometimes we have spent a lot of energy to elect a new political leader — and then we lean back and expect the government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not much has changed?
That’s because the government is like a far ocean and politics are the 15 cm chiefs.
And what is underneath is what we call bureaucracy.
And we use this word with such contempt.
But it is this contempt that makes this thing, which we possess and for which we pay, something that works against us, something else, and then we destroy ourselves.
People who seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us, we have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that’s where the actual government work takes place.
We have to get into the machine of the government.
So the OccupyTesec movement has done it.
Have you seen these guys?
It is a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed 325-page report that is a response to the sec-memo about the gesetzesvorlage zur finanz-reform.
This is not to be politically active, that is to be bureaucratically active.
Now, for those of us who have abandoned the government, it is time for us to think about the world we want to leave behind to our children.
You have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face.
Do we really believe that we<unk> what we need to<unk> without improving that one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
A government is absolutely necessary, but it must become more efficient.
The good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally change the function of government in a way that can actually<unk> something by strengthening society.
And there is a generation that has grown up with the Internet, and who knows that it is not so difficult to do things together, you just have to build the right systems.
Now that the average age of our fellow is 28, so I am, unfortunately, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as a matter of course.
They are not fighting this struggle, which we all fight, so whoever is allowed to speak; they are all allowed to speak.
They can express their opinion, on any channel at any time, and they do it.
So when you are faced with the problem of government, don’t worry so much about using your votes.
They use their hands.
They use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government.
And these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities.
that could be, a hydranten freizuschaufeln, unkraut to throw away, a milleimer with a beutelratte to wrap.
And of course, we could have freed these hydrants all the time, and many people do that.
But these apps are like small digital reminders that we are not just consumers, and we are not just consumers of the government, paying taxes and receiving benefits.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we will not improve the government until we improve citizenship.
So the question I have for you all here: when it comes to the big, important things that we must do together, all together, will we be just a bunch of voices, or will we also be a bunch of hands?
Thank you thanks.
Usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are emerging will be. and I thought, since I am here among friends, I would tell you what I really think. and also try to look back and understand what is really going on here, with these incredible leaps forward, which happened so quickly that we can hardly keep up.
I will start by briefly showing you a single, boring madness.
Can you please briefly show the madness?
This is a folly, which I selected by chance from my folder.
I am not concerned with the details of the folly, but rather with the general form.
This follicle shows data from an analysis of the performance of risk processors compared to the performance of a local area network.
The interesting thing here is that this foil, like so many others, which we often encounter in our field, is an art just on a semi-logarithmic curve.
In other words, each step here corresponds to a potenz in the performance scale.
And it is a novelty that we have to use this type of scale on semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology.
Something very strange is happening here.
This is essentially what I am going to talk about here.
So, if you please, you could turn on the light again.
Even more, because I will soon draw something on the paper here.
So why do we draw graphs in the technique on semi-logarithmic curves?
The reason for this is that if I would draw it on a normal curve, where, say, here are the years, so are the times of a species, and that here is any mass of technology, which I want to portray with a graph, then the graph will be albern.
They look like that.
And that doesn’t say much to us.
Now if I want to record another technology, say a transportation technology, then on the semi-logarithmic scale it would come very unreasonably, in the form of a flat line.
But if something like this happens, then this changes the qualitative circumstances.
So if transportation technology progressed as fast as microprocessor technology, then overmorrow we could get in a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in Tokyo.
But it doesn’t go so fast.
This has never happened before in the history of technological development, this kind of recursive growth, by which the gross order increases exponentially every few years.
The question I would like to ask you now is, if you look at these exponential curves, you see, they do not go on forever.
It is not possible for everything to evolve forever and forever as quickly as it is now.
There are two possibilities:
Either it becomes a classic s-curve like here, until something entirely new thereforecomes, or it will happen here.
That’s about that.
Well, I’m an optimist, so I think something like this will happen in the art.
If that’s true, then that means we’re here in the middle of a transition.
We are here on this line, in a transition from the previous world to a new kind of world.
So the question I would like to ask myself, and I often ask myself, is how will this new world be?
What is this new state that the world is slowly accepting?
Because the transition seems very, very confusing when you are in the middle of it.
When I was a child, the future was somewhere around the year 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000.
Now we have a conference here where people talk about the future and it is noted that the future still lies in the year 2000.
Further than that, we will not go.
In other words, the future has shrunk by one year every year since I came to this world.
I think the reason for this is that we notice that something is wrong.
The transition is happening. we can all feel it.
And we know that at the moment it simply doesn’t make sense to try to look 30 or 50 years into the future, because everything will be so different that a simple calculation of what we are doing now simply doesn’t make sense.
I would like to talk about what that could be, this transition we are currently in.
In order to do this, I will first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers.
Because I believe that in order to really understand this, we must step back and look at the matter on a longer time scale.
I would like to look at this on the time scale of life on earth.
I think the overall picture makes sense if you divide it into a few billions of steps.
So we go back 2.5 billion years ago, and the Earth was a large, sterile stone clump with many chemicals swimming on it.
Now, if you look at the way these chemicals were organized, it gives us a pretty good picture of how they worked.
I also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with RNA, but I will tell you a simplified story of which is that at that time small öltröpfchen herumschwebten, which contained different types of recipes for chemicals.
Some of these oil drops contained a special combination of chemicals, which allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and thus grow.
Everyone who was like that began to divide.
These small oil drops were, in the sense, the most primitive cellular form.
However, these oil drops were not<unk> alive in today’s sense, because each of them was just a small, random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it divides, the chemicals in it are distributed in unequal amounts.
So each tröpfchen was a little different.
In fact, the tröpfchen, which one had a more optimal composition for growth, grew faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster.
They also tend to survive longer and multiply on a larger scale.
So this is just a very simple chemical form of living, but it becomes more interesting if these tröpfchen learn a trick about abstraction.
In some way, which we do not yet fully understand, these tröpfchen have learned the ability to write down information.
They have learned to store the cell’s recipe as information in a specific chemical form, which we call DNA.
In other words, in this spiritless, evolutionary art they have found a way that allowed them to write down what they consisted of so that this information could be stored and copied.
The amazing thing is that this kind of information to be stored over the time of 2.5 billion years, in which it was created, remained the same.
In fact, the recipe for us, namely our genes, consists of exactly the same code and the same writing.
Every living being uses the exact same letters and the same code.
We are so far away that, only for the sake of fun, we can write our own sache in this code.
And I have here 100 micrograms of a white powder, which I try to keep away from security personnel in the airport.
There is – what I did is, I took this code – the code consists of normal letters, which we use to symbolize – and I wrote my business card on a piece of DNA and reinforced it 10 ^ 22 times.
So if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card, I have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world, and it’s right here.
If I had really been an egoist, I would have written it on a virus and released it into the room.
So what is the next step?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.
And that’s what these cells were predisposed to do – that’s what made them happy for another billion years.
But then another, much more interesting step occurred, in which those things became completely different, namely, these cells began to communicate and exchange information, so that communities of cells arose.
I don’t know if you already knew this, but bacteria can actually exchange their DNA.
This is also why, for example, antibiotic resistance is growing.
Some bacteria have found out how to stay away from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria into the DNA and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because those bacteria communicate with each other.
This communication now allowed the founding of communities, which in a sense were in the same boat; they were synergistic.
So either they survived together, or they went under together, which meant that if a community was successful, all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and preferred by the evolution.
The transitional point is now where these communities have come together so closely that they have decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a sign chain on the DNA.
And the next interesting phase lasted about another billion years.
At this point, we have multi-cellular communities, communities of many different cell types, which function together as a single organism.
In fact, we are also such a multi-cell community.
We have many cells that are no longer placed on their own.
Your hautzellen are useless without herzzellen, muscle cells, brain cells, and so on.
Thus these communities began to develop further, so that the level on which the evolution took place was no longer the individual cell, but the entire cell community, which we call an organism.
The next step is now taking place within these communities.
The cellular communities began to abstract information again.
And they developed special structures, which did nothing but process information within the organism.
And these are the neural structures.
The nerve cells are also the information processing apparatus that these cellular communities have built up.
They began to train specialists within the community, special structures that were responsible for learning, understanding and retaining information.
And this was the brain and nervous system of these communities.
This gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at this point an individual’s learning now occurred within the life span of a single organism, rather than over that evolutionary time span.
An organism could also learn, for example, not to eat a certain fruit because it tasted badly and made it sick the last time it ate it.
This could now happen within the lifetime of a single organism, whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago it took, because this information had to be learned evolutionarily by the individuals who died because of this fruit, since these information processing structures had not yet existed.
The nervous system also has the evolutionary process using these special information structures because the evolution could now take place within an individual.
It could take place within a time frame of learning.
What happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other.
For example, the most refined version of this communication method is the human language.
It’s a rather astonishing invention when you think about it.
I have a very complicated, disorderly and confusing idea in my head.
I’m sitting here and giving basically grounding tones of myself, hoping to create a similarly confused idea in your head, which has a certain resemblance to my original idea.
We also take something very complicated, wandeln it in töne um, a sequence of tones, and thus produce something very complicated in the minds of others.
This also allows us to function again as a unified organism.
And what we have actually done, we, humanity, is, we have begun to abstract.
We go through the stages that multicellular organisms have gone through – the abstraction of our methods, how we retain, present, process data.
The invention of the language, for example, was a small step in that direction.
Telephony, computer, video tape, CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we have built in our community to handle this information.
And it connects us all together to something much larger, and also capable of developing faster than we have been before.
Today, evolution can also take place in the timeframe of microseconds.
You have also seen thousands of small evolutionary examples where is a bit of evolution in the &quot;convolution &quot; program has shown, right in front of your eyes.
So now we have accelerated the time scales again.
The first steps of history, which I told you, took a billion years each.
The next steps, such as the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
Then the next steps, such as language and so on, took less than a million years.
And these next steps, like electronics, seem to only take a few decades.
The process feeds on itself and thus becomes, I believe, auto-catalytic is the word for it – when something increases its speed of change.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
And I think that’s what we see here in this explosive curve.
We see the process that feeds on itself.
I live a career of building computers and I know that I could not use the mechanism I use to build computers without the recent advances made in computer technology.
My current activity is to design objects with such high complexity that it is impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
I don’t know what each single transistor in the connector machine does.
There are billions of them.
What I do instead, and what the designers of thinking machines do, is that we think on a certain level of abstraction, pass it on to the machine, and the machine makes it something that far exceeds our abilities, better and faster than we could ever do ourselves.
And it does it in part with methods that we do not even properly understand until now.
One method, which is<unk> interesting, and which I have often used lately, is evolution itself.
In this process, we install an evolutionary process in the machine, which runs in the microsecond range.
To give an example, in the most extreme cases, we can create a program that develops from random instructions.
We say, "computer", please generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions.
Now please execute all these randomly selected instructions, execute all the programs, and finally select those that are closest to my predictions.
So in other words, I first define what I want.
Let’s say, I will sort numbers, that would be a simple example, which I have already used for this.
So find programs that can sort by number.
Of course, with randomly chosen instructions, the chance is very small that they will sort by chance just by number, so probably none of the instructions will actually do this.
But one of them may, with a little luck, put two numbers in the right order.
Now I say, "Computer," take now those 10% of the sequences that came closest to my predictions.
Save this ab, delete the rest.
Now it reproduces all the remaining ones, which have sorted those numbers best.
and with a method of recombination, analogue to continuous planting. &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their sub-routines, and the children inherit the features of the sub-routines of the two programs.
Now I also have a new generation of programs, created by combinations of programs, which have come a little closer to the predictions than others.
say &quot; please repeat this process. &quot;
Evaluate it again.
It may lead to some mutations.
Try it again with another generation.
All these generations only need a few milliseconds.
And so I can make an evolution through millions of years in the computer within a few minutes, or in more complicated cases a few hours.
Finally, I get programs that can sort the numbers perfectly.
In fact, these programs are so much more efficient than any program I could have written by hand.
When I look at these programs, I cannot tell you how they work.
I have tried to understand you.
They are confusing and strange programs.
But you do the job.
I know and am sure that they will do the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job.
Because your life depends on whether you did the job correctly.
I once sat in a 747 with Marvin Minsky, but there is a map highlighted and says, "Oh, look.
“This aircraft consists of hundreds of thousands of small parts, which work together to make their flight safer.
We know that a development process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated.
So we begin to rely on computers, for a process that is very different from classical engineering.
It allows us to produce things with a much greater complexity than normal methods would allow.
And yet we do not yet fully understand the possibilities of this.
We are also overwhelmed by the technology.
We use these programs now to make the computer much faster, so that we are able to run these processes even faster.
There is also a backlink.
It’s getting faster and faster and I think that’s why it seems so confusing.
Because all of today’s new technologies feed on themselves.
We raise AB.
We are at a point that is analogue to then, when single-cell organisms have evolved into multicellular organisms.
We are therefore the amobes and we cannot yet fully understand what hell we are actually creating here.
We are in the middle of this transition.
But I really believe that something will come after us.
I find it very arrogant to say that we are the end product of evolution.
And I believe we all here are part of the creation of what may come next.
Now, lunch is coming and I think I’m listening here now, before I’m elected.
My story begins right here in Rajasthan, about two years ago.
I was under the starry sky in the desert together with Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
We talked about that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata. &quot;
When we were going to travel, we jumped into a car and whirled over the sky.
Now let’s do that with the aircraft.
At that time, when the great Indian warrior prince Arjuna had thirst, took a bow, shot in the ground and water emerged.
Now let’s do that with bohrers and machines.
We came to the conclusion that magic and magic have been replaced by machines.
That really made me sad.
I get a bit afraid of technology.
I was afraid that I could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweeting to my friends.
I found that technology should make magic possible and not kill.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his small silver pocket clock.
This 50-year-old piece of technology has become the most magical thing for me.
It became a golden access to a world full of pirates and crashed ships and to be imagined in my imagination.
It seemed to me as if our shiny watches and cameras kept us from dreaming.
They kept us from being inspired.
So I went into the world of technology to see how I could use it to enable magic instead of killing.
At the age of 16, I started illustrating books.
When I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that can connect readers all over the world.
He can know how we keep it.
He can know where we are.
It brings together images and text, and animation, noise and touch.
Storytelling requires more and more meaning.
But what do we do with it?
Now I just go to khoya, an interactive ipad app.
Here it says: &quot;Put your finger on every light. &quot;
And so -- here it says: &quot;This box belongs to ... &quot; Then I write my name.
and I become a figure in that book.
And again a brief for me falls down – and that the iPad knows by GPS where I live – that is correctly addressed to me.
The child in me is really enthusiastic about such opportunities.
I’ve talked a lot about magic.
I do not mean magicians and dragons, but the magic of childhood, those ideas that we all had as children.
I always found glühwürmchen in a glass very exciting.
So you have to pick up the iPad here and get the glitters out.
And they illuminate the way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child is that an entire galaxy can be stuck in a single mumble.
And so here every book and every world becomes a little murmur, which I draw here to the magical device in the machine.
This opens up a map.
Fantasy books have always had cards, but these cards were static.
This map grows and shines and serves as an orientation in the rest of the books.
It also appears in other parts of the books.
I am going in here.
It is also important for me to create something that is Indian but also very contemporary.
These are the asparagus.
We’ve all heard of fairies and nymphs, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts who are apsaras?
The poor apsaras were imprisoned for thousands of years in indras chambers, in an old muffigen buch.
And we bring them back, in a contemporary story for children.
A history that deals with new issues, such as the environmental crisis.
On the subject of the environmental crisis, one of the major problems of the last 10 years is that children sit in their bedrooms, at their computers, without going out.
But now, with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
In an interaction of books, one is sent to a search. one has to go out and use the camera of the iPad to collect images of more natural objects.
As a child, I had sammlungen of stucco, stones, kieseln and mushelen.
Somehow the kids don’t do it anymore.
You have to go out in a chapter to take a picture of a flower and mark it.
In another chapter, one has to photograph and mark a piece of tree shell.
In this way, one actually creates a digital collection of photos, which one can then post online.
A child in London shows the picture of a fuchs and says: "Oh, today I saw a fuchs."
A child in India says: &quot;Today I saw an affen. &quot;
This creates an art social network around a digital collection of photos that you have actually taken.
There are a variety of ways in which magic connects the world and technology.
In the next book we plan an interaction in which the video of the iPads is used and through augmented reality an animation of elephants is seen, which appear on a plant in front of the house.
At one star, the screen is filled with blättern.
You have to make the noise of the winds, blow them away and read the rest of the book.
We are all moving toward a world in which the forces of nature of technology come closer and in which magic and technology can come closer together.
We use the energy of the sun.
We bring our children and ourselves closer to the natural world here and to the magic, fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story.
Many thanks.
This is truly an extraordinary honor for me.
I spend most of my time with people in custody, prisons, or todeszellen.
I spend most of my time with the most vulnerable in social buildings and places where there is a lot of hopelessness.
Being here with Ted, seeing and hearing how stimulating that is, has given me a lot of strength.
In a short time here, one thing became clear to me: Ted has an identity.
You can say things here that have worldwide influence.
And sometimes, when something comes over Ted, it gets a meaning and power that it would not otherwise have.
I say this because I believe that identity is very important.
We saw some fantastic presentations.
I think we have learned that the words of a teacher have meaning, but that the words of a committed teacher are<unk> meaningful.
As a doctor, you can do good things, but as a more careful doctor, you can do even more.
That is why I want to talk about the power of identity.
By the way, I don’t have this in my work as a lawyer.
I learned this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a family, a traditional African-American household, dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was a toffe, strong woman, she had an effect.
She had the last word in every family dispute.
It was also the starting point of many quarrels in our family.
She was the daughter of a slave family.
Her parents were born in Virginia in the 1840s as slaves.
She was born around 1880 and the experience of slavery shaped her worldview very strongly.
My grandmother was strong, but she was also loving.
When I met her as a young boy, she approached me and embraced me.
She pressed me so tightly that I could barely breathe.
One or two hours later, when I met her, she approached me and said, “Bryan, do you still feel my embrace?”
And when I said “no,” she hugged me again; when I said “yes,” she left me alone.
It was something that made you want to always be near her.
The only problem was that she had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of the ten children.
Sometimes, when I wanted to spend time with her, it was difficult to get her attention.
My cousins lived everywhere.
I remember, I must have been eight or nine, that one morning I woke up and went into the living room.
My grandmother sat down at the end of the room and stared at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
I looked at her and smiled, but she looked very serious.
It took 15 or 20 minutes. then she stood up and came over to me. she took my hand and said, “Come, Bryan. you and I, we have to talk.”
I still remember it as if it was yesterday.
I will not forget it.
She took me out and said, “Bryan, I’ll tell you something, but you have to promise that you won’t go on.”
I said, “I promise you, brother.”
She said, “Ehrenwort?” I said, “Yes.”
She sat down and looked at me, and said, “I want you to know that I have watched you.”
She said, “I think you are something special.”
She said, “I believe you can do anything, whatever you do.”
I will not forget that.
Then she said, “You only have to promise me three things, Bryan.”
I said, “OK, grandmother.”
She said, “Promise me first that you will always love your mother.”
She said, “Your mom is my baby and you have to promise me that you will always take care of her.”
I worshiped my mother, and I said, “Yes, grandma, I will do that.”
Then she said, “Next promise me that you will always do the right thing, even if it’s hard to do the right thing.”
I thought about it and said, “Yes, baby, I promise it.”
Finally, she said, “The last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol.”
Now, I was nine years old and so I said, “Yes, grandmother.
I grew up in the countryside, in the old, rural south, and I have a brother who is one year older and a sister a year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15, one day my brother came home and brought this six-pack of beer with me and my sister and snapped up and went with us into the woods.
We live there just as loudly as ever.
Then he took a glass of beer and gave my sister one, and she took one, and then they offered me one.
I said, “No, no, no. Okay. do you only. I don’t want a beer.”
My brother said, “Well, today we do this, but you do all the other things we do.
I had a whisky, your sister had a whisky, go, drink a beer.”
I said, “I don’t want to. do you just. do you just.”
My brother stared at me.
He said, “What’s going on with you? now drink but was.”
Then he looked into my face and said, “Oh no, you’re not still getting crazy because of the conversation with yours?”
I said, “What are you talking about?”
He said, “My sister tells everyone that you are special.”
I was on the ground destroyed.
I will confess something to you.
I probably shouldn’t do that.
This may be publicly transmitted here.
I am 52 years old and I confess that I have never drunk a drop of alcohol before.
I do not say this because I believe it is virtuous; I say this because identity means power.
If we create the right kind of identity, we can tell people around us things they initially don’t believe.
We can get them to do things they thought they couldn’t.
Of course, my grandmother would say to all her knees that she is something special.
My grandfather was in prison during the Prohibition.
My uncle died of alcohol-induced illnesses.
And she believed that these were the topics we had to take care of.
I have tried to say something about our justice system.
This country is different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in weekends and in prison.
Today it is 2.3 million.
The United States today has the highest prison rate in the world.
Seven million people are fired on probation or with conditional suspension.
In my opinion, mass imprisonments have fundamentally changed our world.
In socially weak and black parts of the population, despair and hopelessness prevail due to these changes.
One in three male blacks aged 18 to 30 are in jail, in jail, on probation or with conditional suspension.
In urban communities everywhere in the country – from Los Angeles to Philadelphia, Baltimore to Washington – 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in custody, in prison, on bail or with a conditional suspension.
But our system is not only shaped by issues related to race belonging, it is also distorted by poverty.
We have a justice system in this country that treats them much better when they are rich and guilty than poor and innocent.
vermögen, not verschuldnen, affects the outcome.
Nevertheless, we seem to be quite satisfied with it.
A policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems.
We have lost that contact.
I find it interesting.
There are a few highly interesting developments.
Alabama permanently deprives them of the right to vote if they are convicted.
Here and today in Alabama, 34 percent of the male black population have permanently lost their right to vote.
We predict that in ten years the rate of deprivation of civil honour rights will be as high as it was before the adoption of the electoral law.
The silence is earsome.
I am representing children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States of America is the only country in the world that sentences thirteen-year-olds to death in prison.
In our country, there are life sentences for children without conditional punishment.
We have already run a lot of procedures.
The only country in the world.
I represent man in todeszellen.
The question of the death penalty is an interesting question.
We believe because we are so taught that the real question is: does a man deserve to die for a crime he has committed?
This is a very sensitive question.
But one can also think differently about it, depending on how we see our identity.
The other is not: Does someone deserve to die for a crime, but: Do we deserve to kill?
I find it fascinating.
The death penalty in America is defined by misconduct.
On the nine people we have executed, comes one we found innocent, who was discharged and released from the dead cell.
One in nine innocent people.
I find it fascinating.
We would never let anyone fly with one plane, if for nine aircraft that take off, one crashes.
But somehow we can do it, we can get rid of this problem.
It is not our problem.
It is not our burden.
This is not our struggle.
I talk a lot about this question.
I’m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill.
And it’s exciting, because I teach my student African American history.
I am talking about terrorism, the time against the end of reconstruction, until the beginning of World War II.
We don’t really know much about it.
But for the African Americans in this country, it was a time of terror.
In many cases, people had to be afraid of lynchmobs.
Or the bombs.
It was the fear of terror that shaped their lives.
These elderly people now come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you talk, you give lectures, you tell the people that you should stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation, we have to deal with terrorism: after September 11th."
They will say, “No, say to the human being that we have grown up with it.”
And after terrorism came, of course, racial segregation and decades of racist-motivated subjugation and apartheid.
And yet there is a dynamic in our country... we don’t like to talk about our problems.
We don’t like to talk about our history.
Therefore, we do not really understand the significance of our actions in the historical context.
We are constantly striking each other.
We are constantly creating new tensions and conflicts.
It is difficult for us to talk about race, and I believe that is because we are not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people have understood that racial separation cannot be overcome without the readiness to truth and reconciliation.
Even after the genocide in Rwanda, there was this preparedness, but not in this country.
I have held several lectures in Germany on the death penalty.
It was fascinating, because one of the scientists stood up after my lecture and said, “You know, it’s deeply disturbing to hear you talk like this.”
He said: “There is no death penalty in Germany.
And of course, it can never be in Germany anymore.”
Then one woman said: “With our history, it is impossible that we ever again speak for the systematic killing of people.
It would be unconscious of us, consciously and purposefully targeting people.”
I was thinking about it.
What would it be like to live in a world in which the German state could execute people, especially if there were disproportionately many Jews among them?
It would be unbearable.
It would be conscientious.
And yet, here in this land, in the states of the Old South, we are directing people – here the risk of being sentenced to death is eleven times higher if the victim is white than if it is black 22 times higher if the accused is black and the victim is white – in the same bundesstaates, in whose soil the bodies of men and women rest.
And yet there is that mental disconnection.
I think our identity is threatened.
If we do not deal with these difficult topics, then the positive and wonderful things are also affected.
We love innovation.
We love technology and creativity.
We love entertainment.
But ultimately, these realities are overshadowed by leads, abuse, reduction, limitation.
It seems to me that it is important to combine both.
Because we are ultimately talking about the fact that we need more hope, more commitment, more dedication in order to survive in a complex world.
For me, it means time to raise, reflect and talk about the poor, the disadvantaged, those who will never be with Ted.
But think in a way that is integrated into our own lives.
In the end, we all have to believe things that we cannot see.
No matter how rational we are, we value intellect as much.
Innovation, creativity, and development do not only come from our heads.
They come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts.
It is this head-heart connection, from which I believe it drives us not only to be open to all the bright and exciting things, but also to the dark and problematic.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech politician, once said:
“When we fought in Eastern Europe against oppression, we wanted everything possible, but what we most needed was hope, a spiritual orientation, the willingness to be, sometimes a hopeless place, and to be a witness.”
This spiritual orientation is the core of what I believe the Ted communities must also engage in.
There is no limitation on technology and design that allows us to be completely human, as long as we do not have eyes and ears for poverty, exclusion and injustice.
This kind of identity demands much more from us than if we didn’t care about it.
It will touch you deeply.
As a younger lawyer, I had the great privilege to meet Rosa Parks.
Mrs. Parks came back to Montgomery, where she met two of her oldest friends, these older women, Johnny Carr, who had organized the Montgomery bus boycott – an incredible African American – and Virginia Durr, a white woman whose husband, Clifford Durr, Dr. King represented.
These women also met and just chatted.
Then the woman called me and said, “Bryan, Mrs. Parks is coming to the town.
“Would you come and listen?”
And I said, “Yes, I’d like to.”
She said, “And what are you going to do when you are here?”
I said, “I’ll listen.”
And I walked over and just listened.
It has always been so inspiring, so beflügelnd.
One day I sat there and listened to these women, and after a few hours, the woman of Parks turned to me and said, “Now Bryan, tell me what the ‘initiative for equal rights’ is.”
What are you trying to<unk>?”
I started with my usual speech.
I said, “We try to act against injustice.
They want to help people who have been condemned innocently.
We want to combat bias and discrimination in the prison system.
We want to abolish life sentences without conditional punishment for children.
We want to do something against the punishment.
We want to reduce the number of prisoners.
We want to abolish mass incarceration.”
I kept my usual speech, and then she looked at me and said, “MHMM.MHM.MHM.”
She said, “That will make you very, very tired.”
Then Mrs. Carr bowed to me, put a finger on my face and said, “and so you must be very, very brave.”
And that’s why I think the Ted community should be more brave.
We need to find ways to face these challenges: these problems, this leap.
Because ultimately our humanity depends on our all humanity.
In my work, I have learned very simple things.
I learned a few very simple things.
That we are all more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.
I think this applies to every person on the planet.
If someone lies, he is not just a liar.
If someone takes something that does not belong to him, he is not just a thief.
Even if someone kills someone, he is not just a murderer.
And because that is so, there is a basic human will that must respect the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and<unk> in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I do not believe that.
I believe that in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that although it is so dramatic, so beautiful and inspiring, and so exciting, we are still not measured by our technology, not by the things we develop, not by our intellect and mind.
Ultimately, a society is not measured by how it treats its rich and powerful and privileged, but by how it treats the poor, the condemned, the imprisoned.
For in this context we only begin to grasp the truly amazing things that make us apart.
Sometimes I lose my balance. a story for the end.
Sometimes I press too much.
I will be tired, like all of us.
Sometimes these ideas precede our thoughts, in a very important way.
I represent these children who have been condemned to very harsh punishments.
I go to the investigative prison and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old, and who is expected to be in court as an adult.
Then I ask myself: How could this happen?
How can a judge turn someone into something that he is not?
The judge sees him as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I woke up too long and thought, my sweetheart, if a judge can turn us into something else, then he must have magic powers.
Richter has magical powers.
You should also ask yourself what you wish.
And because it was late, and I couldn’t think properly anymore, I pretended to work on a proposal.
I had a 14-year-old, Armenian black boy as a client.
And I started with this petition, which was titled: “Ask, my poor, to treat a 14-year-old black mandant as a privileged, 75-year-old white top manager.”
In my petition, I stated that misconduct by the prosecutors and the police as well as procedural errors must be taken into account.
There was a crazy zeal that there is nothing right in this country anymore, that there is only misconduct.
The next morning I woke up and did not know if I had only dreamed of this crazy proposal or had actually written it.
And to my horror, I had not only written it, but also sent it to the court.
A few months passed and I had just forgotten everything.
But in the end, I decided, my God, I must go to court and present this crazy case.
I got into the car and was really overwhelmed – overwhelmed.
I also go to court.
And I thought it would be so hard, so painful.
Finally, I got out of my car and went up the stairs to the court.
When I went up the stairs to the court, there was an elderly man, a black man, who was the housemaster in the court.
When he saw me, he came over to me and said, “Who are they?”
I said, “I am a lawyer.” he said, “You are a lawyer?” I said, “Yes.”
He came to me and embraced me.
Then he whispered is me ins ohr.
He said, “I’m so proud of you.”
And I have to say, it gave me strength.
It touched something very deep in me, identity, the ability of each individual to contribute something to a community, to a perspective of hope.
I betrayed the courtroom.
As soon as the Richter saw me,
He said, “Mr. Stevenson, did you make this crazy proposal?”
I said, “Yes,” and then we began to discuss.
More and more people came here simply because they were angry.
That I had written these crazy things.
Police officers came in and deputy prosecutors and office employees.
In the dream, the courtroom was full of people who were angry that we were talking about skin colour, about poverty, about inequality.
From the corner of my eyes, I saw the housekeeper get up and go away.
He looked through the window again and again and could hear the whole towelbohu.
He went up and ab.
Finally, this elderly black man came into the courtroom with a very concerned expression of his face and sat right behind me, almost on the defence bench.
Ten minutes later, the Richter announced a break.
During the pause, a police officer came in, who was bothered that the housemaster was in the courtroom.
This deputy rushed over to the older black man.
He said, “Jimmy, what are you doing in the courtroom?”
The older black man stood up. he looked at the deputy, then he looked at me, and he said, “I have come here to tell this young man, don’t lose your soul from the eyes.
I have come here because I believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far-reaching, but that it is far-reaching for justice.
We are not fully developed as human beings unless we care about human rights and fundamental values.
that the survival of all of us is linked to the survival of each one of us.
that we must combine our visions of technology and design, of entertainment and creativity with humanity, compassion and justice.
And above all, I would like to just say to those of you who see the same thing: don’t lose your soul from the eye.
You have seen and heard in this audience, this community, an obvious desire to help them and do something.
What else can we do?
Brian Stevenson: Well, there are possibilities everywhere.
If you live in California, there is a people's decision in this spring, which is about actually making an effort to redirect some of the money flow that otherwise flows into the policy of punishment.
Here in California, for example, one billion dollars will be spent in the next five years for the death penalty.
And yet 46% of all homicide crimes do not end with an arrest.
56% of all rape cases do not come to court.
Here is the chance to do something.
This referendum will propose to invest the money in more security forces and security.
I believe there are possibilities everywhere.
Over the past three decades, the crime rate in America has declined immensely.
This fact is often put in connection with the increased incarceration rates.
What would you say to someone who believes this?
In fact, the number of violent crimes has not changed much.
The majority of mass detentions in this country did not actually take place in the class of violent crimes.
It was the misguided crusade against drugs.
This is why there are dramatically high numbers of prisoners.
We have gotten rid of the rhetoric of punishment.
Now we have “three-violation” laws that forever put people behind the grid, for a bicycle thief, for the thief of small goods, instead of forcing them to return those things to the victims.
I think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a crime, not less.
And I believe that our current philosophy of punishment will not help anyone.
I think that’s what we need to change.
Bryan, you really brought a site to swingen here.
You are an inspiring personality.
Thank you for being with Ted.
Bin Laden’s death brings with it a high risk.

Oh my God.
So these are just a few of the clips I’ve collected over the last six months – but it could have been the last six days, or the last six years.
The fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds pay attention to these topics.
And there is also a very good reason for that.
Every second, our minds collect much more information than our brains can process.
And because nothing is more important to us than our survival, the first stop for all that information is a part of our temporal appendix, the amygdala.
The amygdala is also our early warning system, our hazard detector.
It sorts and scans all the information on the search for any hint of danger in our surroundings.
So when we see the news, we prefer to keep an eye out for negative news.
And the old proverb &quot;when it bleeds, the demand rises &quot;is very true.
Now, with all our digital devices delivering us seven days a week, 24 hours a day all these negative news, it’s no wonder that we’re pessimistic.
It is not surprising that everyone thinks the world is getting worse.
But<unk> this is not the case.
Per<unk> that is the reality.
Per<unk> the enormous progress that we have made in the last century through a series of efforts is accelerating so strongly that it will be possible for us to create a world of surpluses in the next three decades.
Well, I’m not saying that we don’t have major problems – climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy problems – we already have them.
And as humans, we are much better at anticipating problems in the long run, but ultimately overcoming them.
Let us take a look at what we have achieved in the last century, so that we can predict the development.
Over the past 100 years, the average life expectancy has more than doubled, and the average income of the world population adjusted to inflation has tripled.
Child mortality has decreased by one-tenth.
Additionally, the costs of food, electricity, transportation and communications have decreased many times.
Steve Pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time in human history.
According to Charles Kenny, the literacy rate has increased from 25% to 80% over the past 130 years.
We live in a truly extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we are constantly raising our expectations.
In fact, we have defined poverty.
Consider that a large proportion of Americans who live below the poverty line have access to electricity, laundry, toilets, refrigerators, TVs, cell phones, air conditioning and cars.
The richest capitalists of the last century, the emperors of the world, could never have dreamed of such luxury goods.
Technologies form the basis for many of these, and these are growing exponentially.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology, where the curve of Moore’s law makes a big leap, and the price-performance ratio doubles every 12 to 24 months.
Therefore, the cell phone in her pocket costs about a million times less and is a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 70s.
Now look at that whore.
This is Moore’s law of the last hundred years.
Pay attention to two things about this curve.
First of all, how smooth it is – in good and in bad times, war or peace, recession, depression, and upheaval.
This is the result of faster computers, which build faster computers.
It does not slow down for any of our major problems.
In addition, despite its logarithmic course on the left side, it runs upwards.
The growth rate itself is also accelerating.
And on this curve, on the back of Moore’s Law, we find a series of exceptional technologies available to all.
&quot;cloud computing &quot;, something that my friends at autodesk &quot;infinite-computing &quot;call, sensors and networks, robots, 3d printers, which allow to democratize the personal production on our planet, synthetic biology, fuels, impfungen und nahrung, digital medicine, nano-materials and artificial intelligence.
How many of you have seen the victory of IBM's supercomputer Watson at &quot;Risk &quot;?
That was great.
I once searched through the newspapers and searched for the best headlines I could find.
I love this : &quot;Watson bezwingt human gegner. &quot;
&quot;Risk &quot; is not an easy game.
It’s about understanding the nuances of language.
Imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available to every owner of a mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, here at Ted, started a new university called singularity university.
We teach our students all these technologies, with a particular focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of mankind.
And every year we ask those students,<unk>, products and services to create that can have a positive impact on the lives of billions of people within a decade.
Think that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people.
Thirty years ago, this would have sounded ridiculous.
Today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done exactly that.
When I think of creating surplus, I don’t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet; it’s about creating a life full of possibilities.
It’s about creating a surplus out of a barren grain.
In fact, scarcity is contextual, and technology is a resource-liberating force.
Here is an example.
This is the story of Napoleon III in the not of the 18th century.
This is the type of left.
The King of Siam was invited to dinner.
Napoleon soldaten bekamen silver-bestick, Napoleon himself bekam gold-bestick.
The King of Siam, however, got an aluminum-bestick.
At that time, aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, more valuable than gold and platinum.
This is why the dome of the Washington Monuments was made of aluminum.
Although aluminum occupies 8.3 percent of the earth mass, it does not appear as a pure metal.
It is bound by oxygen and silicates.
But then the technology of electrolysis was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so inexpensive that we use it with our wasteland mentality.
Let us then project this analogy into the future.
Today we are thinking about energy shortages.
Ladies and gentlemen, we live on a planet filled with 5,000 times more energy than we consume annually.
16 terawatt of energy is spilled onto the Earth’s surface every 88 minutes.
This is not a matter of scarcity, the problem is accessibility.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India was reduced by 50 percent of diesel power – 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy decreased by 50 percent in the past year.
Last month it was published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the U.S. solar energy will cost 6 cents per kWh, compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have an energy surplus, then we will also have water in abundance.
Let’s talk about water wars.
Remember, when Carl Sagan of the Voyager-Space Vehicle in 1990, when Saturn passed by, turned back in the direction of the earth?
Is there a famous photo? what is its name?
&quot;a pale blue dot. &quot;
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet that is 70% covered with water.
Yes, it is 97.5 percent saltwater, 2 percent is required, and we are fighting for 0.5 percent of the waters on the planet, but here there is also hope.
And there are new technologies, not in 10 or 20 years, but now.
There are new nanotechnologies on the way, nano-materials.
And from a conversation this morning with Dean Kaman, one of the innovators of Do It Yourself, I would like to share something with you – he gave me permission – his techology, which is called “slingshot”, and of which many of you may have heard.
It can generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water per tag from different sources – whether salt water, dissolved water, latrine – and all that for less than 2 cents per liter.
Chairman von Coca-Cola has just agreed to launch a large-scale test project with 100 units in developing countries.
And if everything goes well, and I am very confident, then Coca-Cola will use this technology globally in 206 countries across the planet.
This is the technology-driven innovation that exists today.
And we’ve seen this in mobile phones too.
By the end of 2013, we will<unk> a 70 per cent coverage rate of mobile phones in developing countries.
Just think that a Masai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of Kenya has a better mobile communication than President Reagan had 25 years ago.
And if you search on Google with your smartphone, you have more access to knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
They live in a world where information and communication are in abundance, as no one could ever have predicted.
And even better, the things that you and I have spent several thousand dollars on – GPS, HD video and photos, libraries full of books and music, technology for medical diagnostics – are now literally dematerialized and cheaper in their mobile phones.
And<unk> the best thing about it is what awaits us in the field of health.
Last month I had the disappointment, with the qualcomm-stiftung, to announce the so-called $10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize.
Teams around the world are being challenged to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone so that one can talk to the device, as it is equipped with ki, one can reinhost or test his blood values.
And in order to win, the device must make a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors.
Imagine this device in the middle of a developing country, where there are no doctors, but 25 percent of the sickness burden and 1.3 percent of the healthcare workers.
When this device sequences an unknown RNA or DNA virus, it calls the health authority and prevents a pandemic from breaking out.
But now to the greatest force, which will lead us to a world of superfluity.
The next billion &quot;.
The white lines stand for the population.
We have just exceeded the 7 billion mark.
And by the way, the greatest safeguard against a population explosion is better education and nutrition all over the world.
In 2010, we had just under two billion people connected online.
By 2020, we expect to grow from two to five billion Internet users.
Three billion new heads, of which we have never heard before, will join global communication.
What do these people need?
What will they consume? what will they desire?
And instead of economic downturn, I see one of the biggest economic upheavals in history.
These people represent several trillions of dollars, which will flow into the global economy.
and they will become healthier by using the tricoder, and they will be better trained by the Khan Academy, and therefore they will have the opportunity to use 3d printers and infinite computing, and be as much more productive as ever before.
So what can 3 billion growing, healthy, educated, productive members of the human community bring us?
How would it be with a new phrase, not first heard votes?
What about giving the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to draw attention to themselves and bring about change, first of all?
What will these three billion people bring?
What about contributions that we can’t even predict?
One of the things I learned from the X Prize is that small teams, motivated by passion and focus, can create extraordinary things, things that big companies and governments could only create in the past.
I would like to conclude with a story that really excited me.
There is a program that some may already know.
It’s a game called foldit.
It was developed at the University of Washington in Seattle.
And it is a game in which individuals can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop.
Based on its behavior, we can predict its structure and function.
And this is very important in medical research.
So far, this has been a problem for supercomputers.
and this game was played by university professors, etc.
And there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online.
And it showed that today the human pattern recognition folds the protein better than the best supercomputer.
And when these people came and looked at who is the best protein-ordner in the world, this was not a co-professor, nor a caltech student, it was someone from England, Manchester, a woman who worked as an assistant of the business management in a rehabilitation clinic during the day and at night was the best protein-ordner in the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that today we have more power as individuals to face the great challenges of our planet.
We have access to tools with exponential technology.
We have the passion of a DIY-innovator.
We have the capital of techno-philanthropists.
And we have three billion new heads, with which we can work online to cope with the new challenges, and to do what is necessary.
We look forward to a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you very much.
I think we need to do something against a change-worthy piece of medical culture.
And I think it starts with a doctor, and that’s me.
And maybe I’ve been in the business long enough that I can afford to give up a piece of my own false prestige to enable this.
However, before I get to the actual theme of my talk, let’s start with a little baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end of the season and moving towards the world championship.
We all love baseball, right?
Baseball is full of big statistics.
And there are hundreds of them.
&quot;moneyball &quot; appears soon and revolves around statistics and to use this to set up a great baseball team.
I will refer to a statistic that I hope most of you have heard of.
It is the average performance of the striker.
We are talking about a 300, when a beating 300 beats.
This means that the player is sure to hit 3 out of 10 beats.
This means that the ball is hit in the outside field, it comes up, it is not caught, and whoever has tried to throw the ball to the first base has not done it in time and the runner was in safety.
Three out of ten.
Do you know how to call a 300ter in Major League Baseball?
Well, really good, maybe an all-star.
Do you know what a 400ter is called?
That’s someone who, by the way, is sure to hit 4 out of 10.
Legendary – like Ted Williams’ legendary – the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 times during a regular season.
Let us transfer back to my world of medicine, where I feel somewhat better or maybe a little less well after I spoke to you about it.
Suppose you have a blinddarment inflammation and you are transferred to an operator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blinddarment inflammation.
Somehow it doesn’t work, right?
Suppose you live in a certain remote area and you have a loved one with congested coronary vessels, and your primary physician directs him to a cardiologist whose average performance at vascular exposure is 200.
But do you know what?
She’s much better this year, she’s on the upward stage.
And she hits a 257.
Somehow it doesn’t work.
But I will ask you a question.
What do you think should be the average performance for a cardiologist or a krankenschwester or an orthopedist, a obstetrician, a rescue assistant?
1,000, very good.
The truth is that no one in the whole of medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or rescue assistant should be.
What we do, however, is that we send each of them, including me, into the world with the claim to be perfect.
Never make a mistake, but no one is thinking about the details, how to<unk> this.
And that’s the message I received in my medical school.
I was a compulsively obsessive student.
In high school, a fellow student once said that Brian Goldmann would learn for a blood test.
And so was it too.
And I learned in my small rooftop in the sister residence at the Toronto General Hospital, not far from here.
I learned everything outwardly.
In my anatomy lecture, I learned the origin and outflow of each muscle, one branch of a single artery, which leads away from the aorta, obscure and common differential diagnoses.
I can even classify the differential diagnosis for renal tubular acidosis.
And all the time I was gathering more and more knowledge.
And I was fine, I concluded with cum laude ab.
And I left the medical school with the impression that if I knew everything outwardly and knew everything, or at least as much as possible, as close to completeness as possible, I was immune to making mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Drucker.
I resided at a lehrkrankenhaus here in Toronto as Mrs. Drucker was brought to me in the emergency department of the hospital.
At that time, I was assigned to the cardiological schicht in the cardiological service.
And it was my task, when the emergency personal cardiological council sought to examine the emergency patient.
And to give feedback to my doctor.
I examined Mrs. Drucker and she was in short breath.
And when I listened to her, she made a whispering noise.
And as I listened to her chest with the stethoscope, I could hear a knocking noise on both sides, which told me that she was suffering from congestive heart failure.
This is a condition in which the heart fails, instead of pumping the whole blood further, a portion of the blood in the lungs settles and fills it gradually, so the shortness came.
And that was not a difficult diagnosis.
I set them up and took the treatment.
I gave her aspirin, and I gave her medicine to remove the pressure from her heart.
I gave her medicines, which we call diuretics, washing tablets, so that she could drain the fluid out.
And over a period of one and a half to two hours, she pretended to feel better on her own.
I felt very well.
And then I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
I actually made two mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to my doctor.
I did not pick up the listener and do what I should have done, what would have been a call to my doctor in order to clarify it with him, so that he would have had a chance to take a picture of himself.
And if he knew her, he would have been able to obtain additional information about her.
Per<unk> I did it for good reason.
Per<unk> I didn’t want to be a helper.
Per<unk> I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking on his responsibilities that I acted in this way and so I would be able to care for my patients without having to contact him.
My second mistake was worse.
By sending her home, I disregarded a quiet voice within me trying to tell me, "Goldman, no good idea.
I really lacked so much confidence that I sent the krankenschwester who cared for Mrs. Drucker, &quot;do you think it's okay when she goes home? &quot;
and the krankenschwester thought about it and said in fact, &quot;Clearly, I think she will go well. &quot;
I remember it as if it was yesterday.
So I signed the dismissal papers and an ambulance car and rescue assistants came and brought them home.
Then I went back to the work.
The rest of the day, that evening, I had this tingling feeling in my stomach.
But I am continuing to work.
And at the end of the day, I packed my bags, lost the hospital and went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when I did something that I did not do otherwise.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And there another nurse, not the nurse who had seen Mrs. Drucker, but another said three words to me, and these three words fear most emergency doctors I know.
Other doctors fear this as well, but the emergency medicine is very special, because we see those patients only so volatile.
The three words are: Do you remember?
Do you remember the patient you sent home? &quot;
Carried the sick woman sachlich.
&quot;So she is back, &quot; she said in this particular tone.
She was also back.
She was back and dying.
About an hour after she arrived home, after I sent her home, she collapsed and the family called 911. the rescue workers brought her back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50, which is a dangerous shock state.
She hardly rejected and was blue angelaufen.
The emergency personnel pulled all the strings.
They gave her a blood pressure height.
They connected them to the beatmungsmaschine.
I was shocked and broke up inside.
And I went through this backroad because she came to the intensive care station after stabilization and I hoped that she would recover.
And after two or three days, it became clear that she would never wake up again.
She suffered an untreatable brain injury.
Her family gathered together.
And in the course of the next eight or nine days, they gave in to what had happened.
Let them go – Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
It is said that the names of those who die are never forgotten.
And that was the first time I experienced this myself.
In the weeks that followed I blamed myself and experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture – I felt alone, isolated, not the kind of healthy shame that one feels because one cannot talk to the colleague about it.
They all know the healthy shame when one gives a secret of the best friend price, although this one swore on secrecy and then one is caught and the best friend confronts one with it and mine leads a terrible discussion, when one is nevertheless led by a bad conscience and one swears that one will never make such a mistake again.
Repeat the mistake and never make it again.
This is the art of lehrreicher sham.
The unhealthy nature I’m talking about is the one that makes you sick in the deepest.
It is the one who tells one that not what one has done is bad, but that one is bad.
And that was what I felt.
And it wasn’t because of my superiors, he was very kind.
He spoke to the family and I am sure that he smoothed the wheel and made sure that I would not be sued.
But I asked myself these questions quickly.
Why did I not ask the doctor? why did I send her home?
And then in my worst moments: how could I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go to that medicine?
Slowly but surely, it came to pass.
I began to feel better.
And then on a cloudy day, there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out and I thought I might feel better again.
And I acted with myself that if I doubled my efforts toward perfection and never again made a mistake that could silence the voice.
And she did it.
And I continued to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later, I had served in the emergency station in a municipal hospital north of Toronto and I examined a 25-year-old man with an irritated rachen.
It was a lot off and I was in yesterday.
He always showed up here.
I looked in the rack and it was a little pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him forth.
And even as he went out of the class, he pointed to his racket.
Two days later I arrived at my next emergency service and my chief practitioner called me for a conversation in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
&quot;Do you remember the patient with the ravened raven? &quot;
It turned out that there was a streptococcal infection.
He had a potentially life-threatening disease called epiglottitis.
You can google it, but it is not an infection of the backbone but of the upper respiratory tract and causes the blockage of the respiratory tract.
Fortunately, he was not dead.
He was given intravenous antibiotics and recovered a few days later.
I went through the same torture of shame and self-doubt again, felt free and went to Zurich to work until it happened again and again and again.
In one emergency layer, I have overlooked a blinddarmentzündung twice.
There is a lot to this, especially considering that you work in a hospital that at that time only had 14 patients per night.
In both cases, I did not send them home and there probably were no flaws in their treatment.
At one, I thought I’d have Nerensteins.
I ordered the X-ray of the kidneys. if that was without befund, my colleague, while recreating the patient, set a hardening in the lower right sector and called the operators.
The other one had a strong breakthrough.
I ordered fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to review him as well.
And he did, and when he found a hardening in the lower right sector, he called the operators.
In both cases, they were operated and they went well.
Both of these cases are overnight on me, fretting me up.
And I would be happy to be able to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years, which many of my colleagues claim, but is total nonsense.
Many of my crumbs have happened in the last five years.
alone, ashamed and without support.
Here is the problem: if I can’t finish with my mistakes and talk about them, if I have the quiet voice that tells me that what really happened can’t be found, how can I then share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them my mistakes so that they do not do the same?
If I fall into a room like now, then I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard of someone who spoke of failure over failure?
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about some other doctor, but you will not hear anyone about your own mistakes.
If I went into a room full of colleagues and asked for their immediate support and started telling them what I just told them, I would most likely not reach the end of the second story before it really became uncomfortable to them, someone would make a joke, they would change the theme and forget the rest.
And in fact, if I or my colleagues knew that an orthopedist in my hospital had removed someone’s wrong leg, then believe me, I would have trouble looking him in the eyes.
This is the system in which we live.
It is a total denial of errors.
It is a system in which there are two basic positions – those who make mistakes and those who don’t; those who limit sleep deprivation and those without restriction, those with poor results and those with good results.
It is almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack a human being.
And there is the idea that if we banish those who make mistakes from medicine, that a safe system remains for us.
But there are two problems here.
In my approximately 20 years of medical mission awareness and journalism, I have prepared a personal medical study on medical errors and false treatments so that everything I can learn for one of my first articles, which I have for the Toronto star on my show "white coat, black art", "schrieb", to learn.
And what I learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevitable.
We work in a system where every tag error happens, where one in 10 medications is either a false or wrongly dosed, where hospital infections are increasingly numerous and cause devastation or death.
In this state, about 24,000 Canadians die from social misconduct.
In the United States, the Institute for Medicine has a number of 100,000.
Both are strongly underestimated, because we do not look at the problem as closely as we should.
And that is the crux.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years, we can’t keep up.
Sleep shortage is ubiquitous.
We cannot get rid of him.
We have a cognitive defect, so we can take a perfect course of illness for a patient with chest pain.
Then I take the same patient with chest pain, make him sweat and joke and give him another slightly alcoholized breath, and suddenly the story is filled with contempt.
I do not take the same course.
I am not a robot; I do not always do things the same way.
And my patients are not cars; they don’t always tell me their symptoms in the same way.
All that together are errors that are inevitable.
So if you take the system as I’ve been taught, and eliminate all the faulty health experts, then there’s no one left.
And do you know the slander about people who don’t want to talk about their worst cases?
I have the habit of saying, “This is my worst mistake,” I would say to anyone from the rescue assistant to the chief physician of the cardiologist, “This is my worst mistake,” blah, blah, blah, blah, &quot; what’s with her? &quot; and then I go to the microphone with him.
And then their pupils expand, they are struck in front of their heads, then they look down and swallow hard, and begin to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistakes that I made."
What they need is an environment that puts them in a position to do so.
What they need is a new medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor.
The newly defined doctor is a human being, knows about his humanity, accepts it, is not proud to make mistakes, but makes every effort to learn something from them so that it can be passed on.
She shares her experiences with others.
She supports others when they justify their mistakes.
And she shows others their faults, not to expose them, but in a loving, supportive way so that everyone benefits from it.
And she works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans fill the system with life and if so, then humans also make mistakes from time to time.
so that the system develops to create backups that make it easier to detect errors that make people inevitable and it also allows to create loving, supportive spaces in which everyone who monitors the healthcare can actually address things that represent potential errors and even be rewarded for it, and this especially for people like me who make mistakes and should be rewarded for the praise of these.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am the newly defined doctor.
I am a human being, I make mistakes.
I regret it, but I try to learn from it as best I can to pass it on to others.
I don’t know what they think of me, but I can live with it.
Let me conclude with three of my own words: I remember myself.
I’m going to talk about a tiny, small idea.
It is about variable normal values.
And because you can explain this idea in a minute, I will tell you three stories in advance to use that time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
They probably know that it is 1835 here war.
They may think that they are hunting, but that’s not true.
In fact, it is a fish collection.
He described one of them as very &quot;usually &quot; .
It was a zackenbarsch.
Until the 1980s, it was fished in great style.
It is now on the Red List of Endangered Species.
We’ve heard this story many times from the Galápagos Islands or from other locations, it’s not very special.
However, we are still on the way to the Galápagos Islands.
We still think that they are original.
The brochures still describe them as untouched.
What has happened here?
The second story aims to clarify another concept, the variable taillenweite.
For I experienced it when I studied a lagoon in West Africa in 1971.
I went there because I grew up in Europe and wanted to work in Africa later.
I thought I could integrate.
And I got a bad sunburn and was convinced that I really wasn’t from there.
It was my first sonnenbrand.
As you can see, the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees and a few mangroves.
There were buntbarsche of approximately 20 centimeters, schwarzkinnmaulbrüter, an underart of buntbarsche.
The fish grounds of these buntbars were very yield-rich and the fishermen lived well from it and earned well in Ghana on average.
When I returned there 27 years later, the fish had shrunk to half its size.
As an adult, they measure five centimeters.
They were genetically suppressed.
They were still fish.
Those people were still happy.
And the fish also had the luck of still being there.
Nothing has changed, and yet everything has changed.
My third little story is about my association with the introduction of the Schleppnetzfischerei in Southeast Asia.
In the 70s – rather at the beginning of the 60s – Europe supported many development projects.
Fischförderung means land, which has already caught 100,000 fish, and the industrial fischfang of this pretty ugly ship is called mutiara.
I drove on it and we made elevations throughout the South China Sea and especially in the Java Sea.
We had no words for what we figured there.
I now know that it was the cause of the seas.
90 percent of our fangs were sponges, other animals, which are associated with them.
The majority of the fish, the small spots on the drum, the drum, were coral reef fish.
Essentially, the bottom of the sea came on deck and was then thrown back.
These images are extraordinary, because the transition is going very fast.
Within a year, a survey is carried out and then the commercial fishing begins.
From – in this case – a hard foundation or a weak coral, matschiger mist becomes.
This is a dead turtle.
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
One day we figured out a living one.
She was not yet drowned.
Then they wanted to kill them, because they could be eaten well.
In fact, this mountain of drums is collected by fishermen every time they travel in areas where they have never been fished before.
But it is not being documented.
We change the world, but we don’t remember it.
We adjust our norm values to the new level and do not recall what was there.
When it is generalized, the following happens.
There are a few good things on the axis: biodiversity, the number of orcas, the greenery of their land, the water reservoir.
With time it changes, it changes, because for those people their actions are quite natural.
Each generation considers the images they take at the beginning of their conscious life as the standard and will enable everything from it.
The difference is then perceived as a loss.
But they don’t take past losses true.
There can be a sequence of changes.
And in the end, they only want to retain the miserable remnants.
That’s what our soul is now.
We want to retain things that have disappeared or things that are no longer what they were.
One could now think that the problem concerned people who<unk>, while living in predatory societies, killed animals and only after a few generations became aware of what they had done.
Because obviously an animal, which existed very often, rarely gets first before it dies out.
You also don’t lose any frequently occurring animals.
You are always losing rare animals.
Therefore, it is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals and in the ocean they are the big fish.
They are becoming more rare because we catch them.
Over time, little fish remains and we think that’s the norm.
The question is why people accept this.
Now, because they don’t know that it once was different.
Of course, many people, scientists, will confirm that it was really different.
They will confirm it, because the evidence, as they present it in an earlier form, is not the way they would like to present it.
There is, for example, the anecdote that the report of a captain soundso, who observed large fish formations in this area, cannot be used, or is normally not appreciated by fishing scientists because it is not "scientific".
We also have the situation that people do not know the past, although we live in educated societies because they do not trust the sources of the past.
This shows the enormous role that a marine protected area can play.
Because through marine protected areas, we basically put the past back here.
We put back the past here, which people cannot understand because the norm values have changed and are very low.
Thus, the people who see a marine protected area and who benefit from the insight it enables can restore their normal values.
What about the people to whom this is not possible because they have no access – the people in the Middle West, for example?
Here, I think, the art and the film may fill the gap, as well as simulations.
This is the simulation of the Chesapeake Bay.
There was dort grauwale a long time ago – 500 years ago.
And the shades and shades may remind them of a ‘avatar’.
When you think of an avatar, when you think of why those people were so touched by it – apart from von der Pocahontas’ history – why were they so touched by the picture world?
Because it’s something awkward, which in a certain way is lost.
My recommendation, therefore, is that the only one I will give addresses an cameron, so that it is &quot;avatar ii&quot; under water.
Many thanks.
In the 1980s, in Communist East Germany, if you owned a writing machine, you had to register it with the government.
They also had to register a sheet of example text from this typewriter.
The reason for this: the government was able to track back where a text was found.
If you found an article with a false thought, you could find the author of that thought.
And we in the West could not understand how anyone could do such a thing, and how much that would restrict freedom of speech.
In our own country, we<unk>’t do that.
But if today in 2011 they buy a new color laser printer from the leading laser printer manufacturer and print a page, then that page has a bright yellow spot printed on each page, in a pattern that clearly follows that page on them and their printer.
This is happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be upset about this.
And that was an example of how our own governments used the technology against us, the citizens.
And this is one of the three main sources of the online problems that exist today.
Let’s take a look at what’s really happening in the world: we can divide the attacks into categories.
We have three main groups.
There are online criminals.
For example here, this is Mr. Dimitry Golubow from Kiev in der Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These people make money.
They use online attacks to make a lot of money, a huge pile of money.
There are several well-known cases of online millionaires, multimillionaires, who earned their money through attacks.
This is Vladimir Tsastsin from Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
Stephen Watt.
Bear Sundin.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tariq al-Dour, and so on and so on.
These people have gained wealth online, but they have acquired it illegally, e.g. by using Trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do our online banking, or even keyloggers, which collected our credit card information when entering through the keyboard while we shop online via an infected computer.
Two months ago, the U.S. Intelligence Service broke the Swiss account of Mr. Sam Jain here, and there were 14.9 million U.S. dollars on that account when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain himself is on free foot, whose place of residence is unknown.
And I argue that today it is more likely that we will be victims of an online crime than a real crime.
And it is very obvious that this will only get worse.
In the future, most crimes will take place online.
The second largest group of attackers, which we can observe today, are not motivated by money.
They are motivated by something else – protests, a meinung, or by their audience.
Groups such as Anonymous have grown over the past 12 months and have become one of the main players in the field of online attacks.
These are also the three main attack groups: criminals, who do it for money, hacktivists, like Anonymous, who resist, but the last group are nations, governments, who lead the attacks.
There are cases, such as those of Von Diginotar.
This is an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens.
Diginotar is a certificate of authority from the Netherlands – or was it that.
Last autumn, it had to be declared insolvent, because diginotar was hacked.
Someone broke in and had thoroughly hacked the system.
And last week, in a meeting with Dutch government officials, I asked one of the leaders of this group whether he thought it was possible that people had died due to the diginotar hack.
And his answer was &quot;Yes &quot;.
How do people die in the wake of such a hack?
Diginotar is a certification body.
They sell certificates.
What do you do with certificates?
Now, a certificate is needed if you have a website with https, with SSL-verschlüsselten diensten, for example Gmail.
Now we all, or many of us, use Gmail or one of its competitors, but these services are especially common in totalitarian states such as Iran, where dissidents use foreign providers such as Gmail, because they know that they can trust them more than local providers and that they are encrypted via SSL connections, so that the local government can’t snuggle in their conversations.
But you can, if you are in a foreign country.
The certification authority hacked and issued fake certificates.
And that is exactly what happened in the fall of Diginotar.
What about the Arab Spring and the things that happened in Egypt, for example?
In April 2011, in Egypt, the rebels robbed the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police and found a lot of files.
In this file there was an order named &quot;finfisher &quot; .
And in this file were the notes of a company based in Germany, which had sold a few programs to the Egyptian government, with which they could – in a very large frame – intercept any communication of the Egyptian citizens.
They had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The headquarters of the company is right here.
Western governments also provide totalitarian governments with aid, so that they can proceed against their own citizens.
But Western governments also help themselves.
For instance, in Germany only a few weeks ago, the so-called State Trojan was found, which was used by German government officials to spitze their own citizens.
If you are suspected in a criminal case, then with pretty certainty your phone will be attacked.
But today we are far beyond that.
They shut down your internet connection.
They use a tool such as the StateTrojan to play their computer with a Trojan that allows them to monitor all their communications, listen to their online discussions, collect their passwords.
So if we continue to think about such things, then the obvious answer of the people would be: "OK, that sounds bad, but it does not concern me, because I am a brave citizen.
I don’t have to worry!
I have nothing to hide. &quot;
And this argument makes no sense.
Privacy must be guaranteed.
Privacy is not a matter of debate.
It is not a choice between privacy and security.
It is a choice between freedom and control.
And while today, in 2011, we can trust our governments, every right we give up is forever abandoned.
And do we trust, do we blindly trust any future government, a government that we may have in fifty years?
These are the issues we will have to deal with over the next 50 years.
It may seem strange to you, but I am a big fan of concrete blockstones.
The first concrete blocks were produced in 1868 and arose from a simple idea: cement modules with fixed dimensions that fit together.
Concrete building blocks quickly became the most widely used building unit in the world.
They put us in the position to build things that were bigger than us, buildings, bridges, one stone after the other.
In essence, the concrete building has become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, Lego came out.
It was called the &quot;automatic binding stone &quot; .
And within a few years, Lego moved into a single household.
It is estimated that more than 400 billion stones have been produced – or 75 stones for every person on this planet.
You don’t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses, bridges or beautiful buildings.
Lego made it possible for everyone.
Lego has essentially created the concrete building block, the building block of the world, and made it a building block for our imagination.
In the meantime, in the same year, the next revolution was announced at the bell labs, the next baustein.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static, intertwined building blocks to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows one to build much larger, more complex circuits, one stone after the other.
But there is one main difference: the transistor was only for experts.
I personally do not accept the fact that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts and so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago, I was in the media lab and I began to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I pretended to develop a little bit of life.
Let me show you how they work.
Littlebits are electronic modules that have a specific function.
They are prepared to be light, tone, motor and sensor.
And the best part is that they connect with magnets.
So you can’t assemble them false herum.
The stones are colored.
Green is the output, blue is the stream, pink is the output and orange is the cable.
So all you have to do is connect a blue and a green and you can quickly build larger circles.
They attach a blue to a green, and they can make light.
you can insert a switch between them and so you have created a small dimmer.
Take the switch out to insert a pulse module, which is here, and you have made a small blinker.
add this buzzer for an additional effect and you have made a noise machine.
I will stop it.
Beyond the simple play, littlebits is actually quite powerful.
Instead of having to program, twist, or twist, let them program with simple, intuitive gestures.
So in order to speed up or slow down the flash, just spin this button and it makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littlebits is that it is a growing library.
We want to bring every single interaction in this world into a ready-to-use stone.
Lichter, tune, solar cells, engines – everything should be available.
We have distributed a little bit of children and watched them play with them.
And it was an incredible experience.
The most beautiful thing is how they begin to understand the electronics that surround them in everyday life and which they do not learn in school.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why the doors of the upzugs remain open, or how an iPod reacts to touch.
We also brought littlebits to design schools.
We also had, for example, a designer with no experience in electronic things, who started playing with little life as a material.
Here we see, with filz, paper and water bottles, like geordie ...
A few weeks ago, we brought a little bit of paper and gave it to some designers who had no technical experience – just cardboard, wood and paper – and told them: “Might was.”
Here is an example of a project they made, a confetti-canon driven by movement.
But wait, this is really my favorite project.
It’s a knete hummer who is afraid of the dark.
For these non-engineers, littlebits became another material, electronics simply became another material.
And we want to make this material available to everyone.
So littlebits is open source.
You can go to the website, download all design templates and restore them yourself.
We want to encourage the world of creators, inventors, co-workers, because this world in which we live, this interactive world, belongs to us.
So, get off and get them to invent.
Many thanks.
