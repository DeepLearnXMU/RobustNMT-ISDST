Spec@@ tac@@ ular W@@ ing@@ suit J@@ ump Over Bog@@ ota
S@@ port@@ sman J@@ hon@@ athan Flo@@ rez jum@@ ped from a helicopter above Bog@@ ota , the capital of Colombia , on Thursday .
W@@ ear@@ ing a w@@ ing@@ suit , he fle@@ w past over the famous Mon@@ ser@@ rate Sanc@@ tu@@ ary at 16@@ 0@@ km / h . The sanctu@@ ary is located at an altitude of over 3000 meters and numerous spec@@ tat@@ ors had gathered there to watch his exploit .
A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road planners struggle to find the cash to m@@ end a cr@@ um@@ bling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and transmit that information to bureauc@@ rats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to over@@ haul the out@@ dated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually d@@ ull arena of highway planning has sud@@ den@@ ly spaw@@ ned intense debate and color@@ ful alliances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is ag@@ h@@ ast .
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Thousands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n. of Governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is bro@@ ke .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
C@@ ars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 cents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
Poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one p@@ enn@@ y when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota .
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay @-@ by @-@ mile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mileage @-@ based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be rig@@ ged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Re@@ p. Bill Sh@@ ust@@ er ( R @-@ Pa . ) , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
The free market@@ e@@ ers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adri@@ an Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transportation secret@@ aries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay @-@ per @-@ mile direction .
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 @-@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most e@@ ager is Oregon , which is en@@ listing 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nev@@ ada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
And the I @-@ 95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ aboard ( including Mary@@ land , Pennsylv@@ ania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nev@@ ada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Concerns about Big Bro@@ ther and those sor@@ ts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Al@@ au@@ dd@@ in Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nev@@ ada Department of Transportation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got underway , the AC@@ LU of Nev@@ ada war@@ ned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full @-@ fle@@ dged tracking devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
Nev@@ ada is among several states now scr@@ am@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California star@@ tu@@ p called Tr@@ ue Mil@@ eage .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uplo@@ aded periodically by mo@@ dem .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ryan Mor@@ rison , chief executive of Tr@@ ue Mil@@ eage .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less intru@@ sive ways to do this .
In Oregon , planners are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hop@@ ing to sell the concept to a w@@ ary public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real @-@ time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; Mot@@ or@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation planners , though , won@@ der if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a gi@@ ant dis@@ traction .
At the Metro@@ politan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra one @-@ time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspir@@ in , &quot; said Rand@@ y R@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
David Bow@@ ie : Four Un@@ published S@@ ong@@ s Rel@@ eased
The British mus@@ ician is full of sur@@ prises this year .
Following The Next Day , released in January , he has put together a del@@ u@@ xe re @-@ release planned for November 04 , featuring several un@@ published tracks .
Four have already appeared on the Internet .
The announcement that David Bow@@ ie was releasing a new album had st@@ un@@ ned the world .
On 08 January 2013 , the date of his 66@@ th birth@@ day , he announced that a new album would be released in March .
After ten years of silence ( his last record , Re@@ ality , was released in 2003 ) and very few public appearances , the British mus@@ ician proved that he could still light up the pop scene .
A fe@@ ast for fans
Not ti@@ red of making sur@@ prises , David Bow@@ ie had more than one trick up his sle@@ eves with The Next Day :
the Th@@ in White Du@@ ke was also planning to re @-@ release the album on November 04 .
He put together a real fe@@ ast for his fans to mark the occasion .
This re @-@ release , ti@@ tled The Next Day Extra , was presented in the form of three dis@@ ks : the original album , un@@ published studio sessions and re@@ mix@@ es , plus a DVD containing the four cli@@ ps that have already been un@@ ve@@ iled .
The Next Day Extra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album : the three songs from the Del@@ u@@ xe edition , five songs specially un@@ ve@@ iled for the occasion , and two re@@ mix@@ es .
Moreover , David Bow@@ ie has introduced this fine box @-@ set through a video .
In it , he presents each of the dis@@ ks plus the accessories provided with them : exclusive photos and sle@@ eves , a note@@ book for sharing your own impressions , a booklet of ly@@ r@@ ics etc .
And finally , he gives a te@@ aser to his new track , At@@ om@@ ica , which is typically in the style of The Next Day , with very prominent guit@@ ars and sk@@ ill@@ fully controlled rock elec@@ trics .
Pre@@ viously Un@@ published Tr@@ acks Rel@@ eased
However , At@@ om@@ ica is not the only track to have been released .
The In@@ former , Like A Rock@@ et Man and Bor@@ n In A U@@ FO are also available on the net .
The In@@ former is double @-@ ed@@ ged - an un@@ settling intr@@ o followed by a bri@@ l@@ liant r@@ ush of sound that progressively slow@@ s down to make way for a pop ball@@ ad .
Was Bow@@ ie trying to make a reference to El@@ ton John &apos;s Rock@@ et Man , or even Grav@@ ity , in his Like A Rock@@ et Man ?
E@@ ither way , with this che@@ er@@ ful track , the sing@@ er seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground .
Space O@@ dd@@ ity , by comparison , was much more solem@@ n .
On Bor@@ n in a U@@ FO , David Bow@@ ie once again refers to his str@@ ang@@ eness : could he have come from another planet ?
The sp@@ ell@@ binding guit@@ ar ri@@ ffs make you want to leave Earth .
In any case , Bow@@ ie enjoys playing the cham@@ el@@ eon in these tracks : in turn , an informer , a roc@@ ket man , possibly a Mar@@ tian ...
He ve@@ ils and reveals at the same time , and lik@@ es to take on different person@@ alities , as he has throughout his career , most notably with his person@@ as : Z@@ ig@@ gy St@@ ard@@ ust and Al@@ add@@ in San@@ e .
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a m@@ ask in the promotional photography for L &apos;@@ Inv@@ itation au Voy@@ age , by Louis V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , of which he is the new face .
He appears in one of their adver@@ ts , broadcast from November 10 .
The Minister of Defence , Rob Nichol@@ son , ins@@ isted that injured soldiers are not sum@@ marily discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life .
Att@@ acked by liber@@ als and ne@@ o @-@ dem@@ ocr@@ ats in the House of Commons , Mr. Nichol@@ son assured that , prior to their discharge , members of the army under@@ went a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
&quot; All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready , &quot; he asserted .
The de@@ trac@@ tors are acc@@ using the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army &apos;s rule of &quot; universality of service &quot; , which requires that personnel be able to carry out a series of varying tasks - to reach the ten @-@ year period of admissibility required for retirement benefits .
They have specifically noted two cases reported in La Presse Canadienne , one involving a soldier discharged last Friday .
L@@ ance Corporal David Haw@@ kins , a reser@@ vist from London , Ontario , was diagnosed with post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder and discharged from the army , despite asking to be kept on for another year to receive a fully @-@ index@@ ed pension .
His case follows that of L@@ ance Corporal Gl@@ en Kir@@ kland , who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service .
Mr. Haw@@ kins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure , with planning and consultation sessions , but that this was totally different than wan@@ ting to leave the army .
&quot; I told them I was@@ n &apos;t ready , &quot; he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday .
&quot; For several months , I asked if there was a way that I could stay on , and they said no , &quot; he adds .
Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan , the army has stru@@ ggl@@ ed to determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat .
Under the current rules , seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented to parliament last year indicates that , of the 1,@@ 218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits .
On Wednesday , the liberal spo@@ kes@@ man for former service personnel , Jim Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked for L@@ ance Corporal Haw@@ kins to be reinst@@ ated , while the ne@@ o @-@ dem@@ ocr@@ at Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to &quot; this sh@@ ame@@ ful practice &quot; .
Dis@@ ney to Laun@@ ch New Anim@@ ated Series on Tab@@ let PC@@ s
American media and entertainment group Dis@@ ney has decided to give priority to tab@@ let PC@@ s over its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children .
The first nine episo@@ des of Sh@@ eri@@ ff Cal@@ lie &apos;s Wild West will be available from November 24 on the site watch@@ dis@@ ne@@ y@@ j@@ uni@@ or@@ .com or via its application for mobile phones and tab@@ lets .
The global launch on the Dis@@ ney group channels is not planned until 2014 , according to the press release from its Dis@@ ney Junior division .
The animation , aimed at children aged 2 to 7 , is about the adv@@ entures of the cat , Cal@@ lie , the sh@@ eri@@ ff of a town in the Wild West where she keeps law and order using a mag@@ ic lass@@ o .
Each episo@@ de contains two 11 @-@ minute stories .
&quot; Inter@@ acting with s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones and tab@@ lets is second nature for children today , &quot; notes Albert Ch@@ eng , vice @-@ president of digital products at the Dis@@ ney / ABC Television Group , in a quote in the press release .
This kind of experience is part of Dis@@ ney &apos;s efforts to &quot; extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are becoming ever more important , &quot; he added .
A survey published by Common S@@ ense Media at the beginning of the week showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of children under 2 already use a tab@@ let or mobile phone , and 72 % of under 8@@ s , compared to 10 % and 38 % respectively two years ago .
Snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snow@@ den , the US intelligence wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German MP Hans @-@ Christian Str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on Thursday met Mr Snow@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testi@@ fying in Germany .
A letter from Mr Snow@@ den , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP , said : &quot; Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .
In the letter , Mr Snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persu@@ ade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
The charges filed by the US justice department include es@@ pion@@ age and theft of government property .
Hans @-@ Peter Fried@@ rich , German interior minister , told Ze@@ it Online : &quot; If Mr Snow@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ gg@@ ed Chancell@@ or Angela &apos;s Mer@@ kel &apos;s phone .
Thomas Op@@ perman@@ n , the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US , &quot; it should be taken .
Mr Str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , an MP for Germany &apos;s Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr Snow@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter feed .
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists .
Mr Str@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the former N@@ SA contractor &apos;s lawyer , Mr Snow@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
If Mr Snow@@ den testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the MP said .
Mr Snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home .
However he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the re@@ vel@@ ation of an un@@ accountable system of per@@ v@@ asive surveillance to be a public service .
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
Co@@ g@@ eco Cable So@@ on to Offer Interactive TV ?
Co@@ g@@ eco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like F@@ ace@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter and , ultimately , the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x video @-@ on @-@ demand service through their television in a se@@ em@@ ingly not too distant future .
The Co@@ g@@ eco subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users .
&quot; This will enable us to develop more user @-@ friendly interfaces and larger numbers of options , &quot; explained the president and CEO of Co@@ g@@ eco , Louis Au@@ det , in an interview .
Co@@ g@@ eco Cable is thus following in the path of its competitors , like Bell , even though the Co@@ g@@ eco subsidiary does not yet have a precise launching date for this new platform .
&quot; We need to adapt and change or res@@ ist change and fail , &quot; emphasized Au@@ det .
The ultimate goal is still to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to .
The telecommunications gi@@ ant Rogers has already indicated that it might offer Net@@ f@@ li@@ x if certain technical details ( which it did not cite ) could be sor@@ ted out .
In the United States , the popular video service is said to be discussing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies .
The CEO of Co@@ g@@ eco and Co@@ g@@ eco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne on October 16 .
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of accessing the services on a pay @-@ per @-@ view basis .
&quot; We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels doesn &apos;t work , &quot; stated Au@@ det .
Nevertheless , he hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radio @-@ television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) will give rise to interesting recommendations .
&quot; These discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television , &quot; said Co@@ g@@ eco &apos;s CEO .
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week , and these will be continued with the industry next spring .
In terms of results , Co@@ g@@ eco has said it has recorded a net profit of CAD 4@@ 3.8 million in the fourth quarter , representing 82 ¢ per share .
This is a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 4@@ 4.9 million , or 83 ¢ per share , recorded in the same period last year .
The Montreal @-@ based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions .
In 2012 Co@@ g@@ eco bought US @-@ based cable distributor , Atlantic Broad@@ band , for CAD 1,@@ 360 million .
This was the company &apos;s first major acquisition after its failed aqu@@ isition attempt in Portugal .
The Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises , an Internet services provider based in Vancouver , for CAD 526 million last December .
In terms of revenue , Co@@ g@@ eco saw growth of 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter , reaching CAD 50@@ 4.7 million .
Its revenue stands at CAD 1,@@ 800 million for the current financial year .
The net profit of its principal subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ eco Cable , was CAD 4@@ 3.9 million , or 90 ¢ per share , down from CAD 4@@ 5.7 million , or 93 ¢ per share , for the same period last year .
Nevertheless , Co@@ g@@ eco Cable saw a 45 % growth , reaching CAD 47@@ 0.4 million .
The company lost 15,@@ 237 customers during the fourth quarter .
Even so , the number of Co@@ g@@ eco Cable customers rose by 5,@@ 546 for the 2013 fiscal year .
Au@@ det is not concerned by this fluctuation in the company &apos;s number of customers .
&quot; For me , this does not indicate a change in trend , &quot; he noted .
&quot; It varies from one quarter to the next in the face of very li@@ vely competition . &quot;
Horse in Be@@ ef Products
Horse meat has been detected in beef @-@ based cann@@ ed food products sold by two small British low @-@ cost distribution retailers , the Food Standards Agency announced today .
Rou@@ tine tests revealed that products processed in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home B@@ arg@@ ains and Quality Save chains contained between 1 and 5 % of horse DNA .
&quot; Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product , &quot; the British agency explained .
A scand@@ al on the presence of horse meat in prepared meals had broken out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests carried out in Ireland .
According to investigations by the European Commission , France the most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain beef only .
Two vehicles col@@ li@@ de on Route 131 in Lan@@ audière leaving four injured Friday morning .
Just before 4@@ am , a driver heading north towards Saint @-@ F@@ éli@@ x @-@ de @-@ Val@@ ois lost control of his vehicle and cr@@ ashed into another car travelling in the opposite direction .
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured , though not le@@ th@@ ally .
Traffic returned to normal at around 6@@ am .
Fron@@ tier Airlines to charge for carry @-@ on baggage
Fron@@ tier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store carry @-@ on lu@@ ggage on board their flight .
Fron@@ tier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry @-@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
The new carry @-@ on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
Fron@@ tier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if trav@@ el@@ ers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
Fron@@ tier spo@@ kes@@ woman K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the $ 100 fee is to get trav@@ el@@ ers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into carry @-@ on baggage st@@ ashed in overhead b@@ ins , meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space .
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
It &apos;s about Fron@@ tier &apos;s most loy@@ al customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
That means one passenger in line at a Fron@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said Fron@@ tier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s new carry @-@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date has@@ n &apos;t been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often gr@@ um@@ ble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
They argue that lu@@ ggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Most haven &apos;t touched carry @-@ on bag fees , though .
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry @-@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later followed .
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s W@@ iz@@ z Air , said airline consultant J@@ ay Sor@@ ensen , who closely tracks add @-@ on fees .
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s carry @-@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ ensen , a former executive with Mid@@ west Airlines , fle@@ w Spirit recently and wondered what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual carry @-@ on bag fee .
&quot; The boarding process was the smooth@@ est I had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .
I was exp@@ ecting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
The plane was full , he said , &quot; and it bo@@ ar@@ ded lic@@ k@@ ety @-@ split . &quot;
Fron@@ tier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or juice .
Fron@@ tier said passengers who get so@@ da or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free .
It will still give away water .
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s move to charge the carry @-@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website .
Airlines pay online travel s@@ ellers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
That has given all airlines an incentive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
Fron@@ tier has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area , though .
In September it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
On Wednesday it sl@@ ashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
So , a 1,000 mile Fron@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fron@@ tier website .
Fron@@ tier has a loy@@ al base of customers in its home city of Den@@ ver , but its business is sh@@ r@@ inking and losing money .
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity sh@@ rank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc .
Republic has been trying to fix Fron@@ tier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .
N@@ SA Bl@@ ames &quot; Internal Er@@ ror , &quot; Not H@@ ack@@ ers , For Website Cr@@ ash
The sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a gl@@ it@@ ch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not h@@ ack@@ ers as some claimed online .
&quot; NS@@ A.@@ gov was not accessible for several hours ton@@ ight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ailed statement .
The issue will be resolved this evening .
Claims that the out@@ age was caused by a distributed denial of service &#91; D@@ Do@@ S &#93; attack are not true .
Ear@@ lier this evening online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noted the N@@ SA &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some users .
Ear@@ lier an N@@ SA spo@@ kes@@ person told ABC News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; compromised .
No classified information is in danger , the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
At least one h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site coll@@ ap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tacti@@ c is a relatively un@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetr@@ ate the internal network of the target system .
The formerly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once n@@ ick@@ named No Such Agency , has found itself in very public light , and am@@ id vic@@ ious criticism , in past months following a stream of re@@ vel@@ ations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret N@@ SA files stolen from the agency and le@@ aked by dis@@ ench@@ an@@ ted former N@@ SA contractor Edward Snow@@ den .
Such growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the agency prompted early spec@@ ulation that ton@@ ight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
Delta Centre @-@ Ville Clo@@ ses
Delta Centre @-@ Ville Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student resid@@ ences .
The hotel had three hundred and fifty employees .
Of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees .
Employers have come to meet employees on site and have met with the employees individually to assess their needs .
&quot; That support will continue for the next six months , &quot; explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels , F@@ eli@@ x B@@ isson .
The closure of the Delta comes at a time of great competitiveness in the hotel market .
The investment fund that owned the building had to make a choice .
It had to either re@@ invest in the building to continue using it , which would require investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fi@@ erce as a lot of new hotels have appeared in Montreal .
or sell it to someone else , which is what happened , &quot; explains Paul Arsen@@ ault , holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management at the U@@ Q@@ AM .
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months , such as the Crown Plaza , which will become a home for the elderly .
Meanwhile , four hotel projects tot@@ aling almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years .
&quot; Plan to buy Good@@ year A@@ mi@@ ens will begin with zero employees , &quot; Tit@@ an CEO says
After dramatically thro@@ wing in the tow@@ el in January over the partial taking over of the Good@@ year site in A@@ mi@@ ens North , which is due to close , Maurice Taylor , CEO of American tire manufacturer , Tit@@ an , now says that he is ready to save 333 of the factory &apos;s 1,@@ 137 employees .
Arn@@ aud Monte@@ bourg , Minister of Industrial Recovery , had already announced this on Monday October 21 .
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January , today you are back .
You had fired violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking of &apos; so @-@ called workers &apos; who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , and &apos; mad &apos; unions , targeting the CG@@ T .
It &apos;s hard to understand this U @-@ turn .
Is this meant to please Mr. Monte@@ bourg ?
I &apos;m not trying to please anyone .
Except my wife .
Mr. Monte@@ bourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry if my words have off@@ ended anyone .
But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too .
Does the truth off@@ end you ?
Working seven hours a day when people in other countries are working eight hours is holding France back .
In India , China and many other countries , people work ten to twelve hours a day .
But I don &apos;t have pre@@ judices about France .
What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural ti@@ res , has good equipment , a good location and plenty of room for growth .
Why does Tit@@ an need this factory so much ?
Tit@@ an doesn &apos;t need to buy this factory .
But , if the price is right and the workers are qualified , it &apos;s worth trying .
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CG@@ T and Good@@ year ?
If Good@@ year had offered the employees a good severance package after announc@@ ing that the factory was closing , I think 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
Now , let &apos;s imagine that Tit@@ an bu@@ ys a closed factory from Good@@ year .
At that point , Tit@@ an could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency .
I think Mr. Monte@@ bourg knows that .
However , he wants to keep the factory in A@@ mi@@ ens with at least 333 well @-@ paid employees .
Tit@@ an has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Good@@ year .
Also , Mr. Monte@@ bourg needs a commitment from Tit@@ an before trying to get the CG@@ T to sit down with Good@@ year .
The first step is for the CG@@ T and Good@@ year to seal an agreement on severance pay for all the employees .
Then there won &apos;t be any employees left in the factory .
Mr. Monte@@ bourg has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years .
Can you confirm that ?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333 .
I know he would like a four @-@ year guarantee .
But , as I said to you , the CG@@ T and Good@@ year must first reach an agreement on the severance pay .
If all the employees accept it , the project of buying Good@@ year A@@ mi@@ ens will begin with zero employees .
How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees left on site ?
If Mr. Monte@@ bourg gets the CG@@ T and Good@@ year to reach an agreement and Tit@@ an bu@@ ys the factory , we have every intention of staying in A@@ mi@@ ens North for more than four years .
Bom@@ bar@@ dier profit di@@ ps as plane deliveries , orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bom@@ bar@@ dier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pres@@ su@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
Montreal @-@ based Bom@@ bar@@ dier also did not release any flight test data for its brand @-@ new C@@ Series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
After the test plane &apos;s inaug@@ ural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flow@@ n three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , an analy@@ st with National Bank Financial , low@@ ered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; While the weak@@ er aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly dis@@ appointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a client note .
We believe that Bom@@ bar@@ dier will receive new orders for the C@@ Series as the flight test program progres@@ ses .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more sk@@ ep@@ tical of the program .
Bom@@ bar@@ dier hopes the C@@ Series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t it into the low end of a market now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .
But firm orders for the C@@ Series are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company &apos;s claims about the new jet@@ lin@@ er &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beau@@ do@@ in was confident Bom@@ bar@@ dier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
Executives also re@@ assured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progress@@ ing according to schedule .
&quot; The test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s down@@ time .
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way .
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
That will happen all through the flight program .
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remainder following shortly after , the company said .
Still , analysts are sk@@ ep@@ tical the first customer can begin operating a C@@ Series plane 12 months after its mai@@ den flight .
Bom@@ bar@@ dier said it was evaluating the entry @-@ into @-@ service ( EIS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bom@@ bar@@ dier &apos;s internal schedule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that entry @-@ into @-@ service will be pushed to Q@@ 1 / 15 , &quot; said Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
For the third quarter ended September 30 , Bom@@ bar@@ dier &apos;s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
Adjust@@ ed earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents .
Revenue di@@ pped margin@@ ally to $ 4.1 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
Analy@@ sts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to Thomson R@@ eu@@ ters I / B / E / S .
The world &apos;s fourth @-@ largest plan@@ em@@ aker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier .
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .
The backlog in the aerospace division was $ 3@@ 2.9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .
&quot; In aerospace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a dis@@ appointment , &quot; Beau@@ do@@ in said .
Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bom@@ bar@@ dier , the world &apos;s largest train@@ maker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
The order backlog in the transportation unit was $ 3@@ 2.6 billion as of September 30 , up margin@@ ally from December 31 .
The transportation division &apos;s margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .
Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .
Shar@@ es of Bom@@ bar@@ dier , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick P@@ ich@@ ette would join the board , were down 8.5 percent at C $ 4.@@ 83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday .
Brazil &apos;s Em@@ bra@@ er SA , the world &apos;s third @-@ largest commercial plan@@ em@@ aker and Bom@@ bar@@ dier &apos;s closest rival , reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday .
Two po@@ th@@ ol@@ ders aged 23 and 27 went missing in a c@@ ave under the D@@ ent de Cro@@ lles on Thursday evening , according to a report from the Is@@ ère c@@ ave rescue organization on Friday .
They were found on Friday afternoon .
The two men , one experienced , the other not , set off underground on Thursday at around 9.@@ 30@@ pm , in an attempt to cross the D@@ ent des Cro@@ lles , which is in the district of Saint @-@ Pierre @-@ de @-@ Char@@ tre@@ use .
There was no news of them after this , said the same source .
&quot; The po@@ th@@ ol@@ ders were due to return at around 5@@ am , &quot; said Th@@ ier@@ ry L@@ arri@@ be , technical consultant at the c@@ ave @-@ rescue organization who organized the rescue efforts .
Do@@ z@@ ens of people on site
Twenty or so res@@ cu@@ ers , ten civilian members of the French c@@ ave @-@ rescue organization , as well as the police , mountain rescue services and fire@@ fighters were on hand .
The two po@@ th@@ ol@@ ders were found late on Friday afternoon .
&quot; Another group of po@@ th@@ ol@@ ders found them in the hol@@ low exhausted but in good health and got a message to one of the rescue teams working in the network of tunnels , &quot; explained local newspaper , Le Dau@@ ph@@ iné .
The two men , who are soldiers in the 13th Battalion of French Al@@ pine Tro@@ ops station@@ ed in Cham@@ b@@ ér@@ y , were found &quot; exhausted but un@@ injured &quot; .
They got lost in the network , but re@@ trac@@ ed their steps while waiting for assistance , said the police .
After being given supplies , they are expected to exit the c@@ ave in the evening with the help of the res@@ cu@@ ers .
German Journ@@ alists Ur@@ ged to Sh@@ un Google and Ya@@ ho@@ o
The union of German journalists urged its members to stop using Google and Ya@@ ho@@ o online services on Thursday , following new re@@ vel@@ ations concerning the activities of the American and British intelligence services .
&quot; The German Federation of Journ@@ alists is recommending that journalists avoid using the Google and Ya@@ ho@@ o search engine and mess@@ aging services until further notice , &quot; it said in a press release .
It calls the reports in the Washington Post &quot; scand@@ al@@ ous &quot; . According to these , the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) in America and the Government Communications Headquarters ( G@@ CH@@ Q ) in Britain have gathered loads of information by infil@@ tr@@ ating international networks , enabling the two bodies to synchron@@ ize their servers .
&quot; The research carried out by journalists is just as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communication with them , &quot; added Michael Kon@@ ken , president of the union , which has 38@@ ,000 members .
Re@@ painted Traffic L@@ ights : MP As@@ ks Brig@@ itte Grou@@ w@@ els to Res@@ ign
Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brig@@ itte Grou@@ w@@ els &apos; plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a &quot; face @-@ lift &quot; .
The Minister of Public Works and Transports in Brussels had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday , consisting in rep@@ ain@@ ting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region .
The aim of this is to both &quot; increase safety &quot; and &quot; enhance the identity of Brussels &quot; .
The idea is to eventually rep@@ aint all the traffic lights in Brussels , at an estimated cost of one million Euro@@ s .
But the blue chosen by the Minister is &quot; too dark &quot; , according to Brussels MP Em@@ manuel De B@@ ock , who talks of the &quot; Flem@@ ishing &quot; of the capital and is demanding the re@@ signation of Brig@@ itte Grou@@ w@@ els .
&quot; Not content with spending Brussels residents &apos; money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a face @-@ lift with the colours of the Brussels region , Brig@@ itte Grou@@ w@@ els is continuing her efforts to turn the capital Flem@@ ish , &quot; says an an@@ gr@@ y De B@@ ock in a press release .
After her mang@@ o yellow and black tax@@ is , she has ended up rep@@ ain@@ ting the posts in Brussels yellow , dark blue and black .
According to the MP , there is now &quot; no difference in visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels .
The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money was@@ ted by a Christian Democratic and Flem@@ ish Minister , who is carrying out the New Flem@@ ish Alliance program herself .
It is high time the Flem@@ ish Tro@@ jan Horse was stopped .
Let &apos;s not forget , Brig@@ itte Grou@@ w@@ els was elected by 2,@@ 245 votes , that is 0.5 % of Brussels inhabitants ! &quot; De B@@ ock concludes .
Pont @-@ de @-@ Bu@@ is Por@@ tico Dis@@ man@@ tled

C@@ ran@@ es arrived on the site just after 10@@ am , and traffic on the main road was diver@@ ted after@@ wards .
The decision to take the por@@ tico down , which was announced by the Fin@@ ist@@ ère police department on Wednesday , was taken by E@@ com@@ ou@@ v , the company managing the por@@ tico .
This was the last of three ec@@ ot@@ ax por@@ ti@@ cos still operating in the department of Fin@@ ist@@ ère , the other two having been taken down or sab@@ ot@@ aged .
Google Gl@@ ass Acc@@ ess@@ ories Shop Laun@@ ched
An online shop offering a range of accessories for Google Gl@@ ass has just been launched for the thousands of developers who own a prototype of the Google @-@ br@@ anded , web @-@ enabled gl@@ asses .
It means they can now get head@@ phones , a charger or even a storage case .
The shop , which is strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Gl@@ ass , offers some accessories , such as a charger and USB cable , for $ 50 .
It is also possible to get a micro @-@ fi@@ ber protective cover or in @-@ ear head@@ phones for the same price .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Gl@@ ass equipped with corrective l@@ enses , no date for a full @-@ scale launch has yet been announced .
Five years ago , my father passed away .
At first , I was in denial about his death . I spoke of him in the present ten@@ se .
I was a@@ fr@@ aid of for@@ getting him , or perhaps I did not know how I was going to continue to &quot; spend time &quot; with him .
There is no formula , no method for passing through the wall of the in@@ visible to be with your loved ones .
Then signs started to appear .
The first time I had this very strong feeling of his presence , he was in the passenger seat while I was driving .
Another time is when I qui@@ et@@ ly wo@@ ke up in the middle of the night and went to look at his watch , which I always have with me , lying on the bed@@ side table .
The s@@ mil@@ ing image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities .
Our mother left us after an exhau@@ sting fight against cancer .
At least , that is what I thought when I saw the shell of her sti@@ ff body under the cr@@ um@@ pled sheets of the hospital bed .
Similarly , her fun@@ eral was a cold good@@ b@@ ye focused on the di@@ m light of the cand@@ les surrounding her coff@@ in .
I thought she had gone .
Gradu@@ ally , by way of tiny and slightly f@@ aint or f@@ aded appearances during the day and night , she soon came back into my life , evolving as she took back her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in m@@ ourn@@ ing .
And then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before , that were hidden by my relationship with her .
Thus , I lear@@ nt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all , just a woman that I did not know very well , a woman who embodied her during her stay on this earth .
In dying , this woman had completed her life and fre@@ ed the person that I loved , and now she was back , whole and complete .
This det@@ our in the path of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing .
It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us .
I am like my father , &quot; inside and out &quot; , it seems .
I have always been told that .
I never believed it at the time .
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill .
At that point I was no longer a@@ fr@@ aid of him and I was able to love him .
One day , he died .
For a long time , he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking , when I was a@@ fr@@ aid , when I was ill ...
He would speak to me , constantly encourage me , he lived in my body .
I would see his hands when I looked at mine ; I lent him my body .
But this was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I could still lead a personal life .
He allowed me my privacy .
That las@@ ted a long time , then one day he was gone .
In the end , it felt comfortable and re@@ assur@@ ing to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I don &apos;t know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me constantly .
In every event , every moment of my life , I feel their presence , and I am always referring to them : what would they say , what would they think , what would they do ?
I constantly dream of them , perhaps not every night , but several times a week for sure .
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late , except that there is still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment .
I often wake up dist@@ ress@@ ed because it h@@ its me and I feel their absence deeply .
Sometimes , some dre@@ ams affect me differently and make an impression on my mind , so , in effect , they continue to live and be a part of my life .
On the day before my ultr@@ as@@ ound , when I was going to find out the gender of my baby , I dre@@ amt that I wo@@ ke up and hau@@ led myself out of bed , and my father was waiting for me on the landing . He was s@@ mil@@ ing at me and was happy that I was exp@@ ecting a little boy .
The following day , I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling .
And , yes , I was indeed carrying a boy .
I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death .
Ex@@ act@@ ly five years ago , my grand@@ mother died of cancer .
One year previously , she had travelled with my family to Cuba .
Hence the shock that her loss provo@@ ked in the young graduate I was then .
In spite of everything , I said my good@@ by@@ es fairly quickly .
But she continues to influence my life , particularly in when I &apos;m going through hard times , or when I have to make an important decision .
Deci@@ ding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East , to the point of doing a M@@ asters at a major university , in hind@@ sight , were not tri@@ vi@@ al decisions .
Actu@@ ally , I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent .
The values she insti@@ lled in me are still there , so I often end up wonder@@ ing what she would want me to do at a given moment .
It &apos;s the same with my opinions : I try to live up to the gener@@ osity and correc@@ t@@ ness of her mind as a fer@@ vent beli@@ ever .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays I feel her as a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent force , a saving spirit .
I see her eyes res@@ ting on me .
My mother died nin@@ et@@ een years ago now .
She died after talking to me on the telephone .
I went through all the stages : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , grief , te@@ ars that would come on their own , anywhere , any@@ time , in unusual places , at incon@@ gru@@ ous moments .
But time eased the pain .
Now there is just the gap , the silent emp@@ tin@@ ess , the need for her to entr@@ ust me , to re@@ assure me in the pal@@ m of her gent@@ l@@ eness .
Yet , she is there , a silent presence , watching me .
Every morning I see her wor@@ ri@@ ed eyes looking at me , I see the dark rings giving her a bur@@ den@@ ed look , the w@@ rin@@ k@@ les around the li@@ ps du@@ g by cigarettes , the lines that mark the fore@@ head on days of wor@@ ry .
My mother has taken possession of my face , and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror .
And every morning , I look away .
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 .
We always feel her protecting us , nothing bad will happen to us .
This was her promise on her death bed ; so , gradually , we lear@@ nt to s@@ mile again , and saying her name is no longer tab@@ oo but a comfort .
Of course , I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hur@@ ts too much , and she comes into my dre@@ ams when my spirits are a little low .
We feel supported and protected in difficult moments , and the passage of time has made us re@@ alise that she was the conduc@@ tor , with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us .
If some@@ body truly loved you , their absence cannot te@@ ar them out your heart or your mem@@ ories .
In a way , the person you loved becomes your inner energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos @-@ related cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated .
I was unable to attend his bur@@ ial , and three weeks after his death , I gave birth to a little boy .
Sometimes my beliefs are different from his , so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conform@@ s with his way of seeing things .
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions .
However , I can &apos;t do otherwise ; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think .
I don &apos;t know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic ?
What@@ ever the case , he will always be my point of reference .
He was a bit like an alter ego , we didn &apos;t even need to speak .
In short , he is there every day .
I feel his presence and it makes me happy .
Almost thirty years ago , my husband died aged 33 .
I was 28 and our son was 6 .
The immense pain that eng@@ ul@@ fed me has eased of course , but he is still close to me .
He very often &quot; turns up &quot; in my dre@@ ams , in a very specific way , so vi@@ vi@@ d that when I wake up I am s@@ ad again when I re@@ alise that it was just a dream .
The other night , he asked me how I was ; I said not good , and he said &quot; I &apos;m coming down &quot; , but in a voice so real that I wo@@ ke up with a start , up@@ set , and I swit@@ ched on the bed@@ side lamp and looked around , convinced that he would come .
I still live in the same house and , frequently , I feel he is watching me ; I turn round and see he isn &apos;t there , but I know it &apos;s him and I talk to him .
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy .
I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t leave this house for anything in the world . We were happy here and his spirit lives here with me .
I &apos;m 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him . He is and will remain the love of my life .
I should say that I am rather soci@@ able and have a job with responsibilities . I lau@@ gh and sing , I go out , I &apos;m a grand@@ mother , I have lots of friends , but my heart and my sou@@ l belong to him . I never talk about him except with my son , and I never go to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
October : B@@ loo@@ di@@ est Month in Iraq Since 2008
October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month in Iraq since April 2008
Baghdad published official figures on Friday : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month - 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police and 44 soldiers .
The publication came on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister met the American President .
N@@ our@@ y al @-@ M@@ ali@@ ki is seeking aid from the United States .
&quot; We are not asking the world to stand by our side and support us , but we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it , &quot; declared Al @-@ M@@ ali@@ ki in Washington this Thursday .
&quot; And because if what is happening in Iraq is not handled , it will spread , as will what is happening in Syria .
And what happens when the virus of terrorism is alive ? It sp@@ reads . &quot;
N@@ our@@ y al @-@ M@@ ali@@ ki was speaking at the United States Institute of Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
Outside the building , demon@@ strat@@ ors were prot@@ esting against the Iraqi leader .
They were br@@ andis@@ h@@ ing plac@@ ards acc@@ using him and others of being mur@@ der@@ ers and appe@@ aling to the United States to refuse to give him aid .
Coc@@ aine @-@ ad@@ dict lawyer who ti@@ pped off Mr Big about police investigation is j@@ ailed
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed information to crime l@@ ord Neil S@@ carb@@ rough
The solic@@ itor fe@@ ared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
Was given a three @-@ year prison sentence at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he fe@@ ared his secret drug addiction would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime l@@ ord Neil S@@ carb@@ rough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine hab@@ it .
The solic@@ itor , who was n@@ ick@@ named &quot; B@@ ash &quot; and h@@ ailed by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into S@@ carbo@@ rough , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ cotics trial .
Officers spo@@ t@@ ted Sar@@ borough , 32 , dro@@ pping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer &apos;s home in Blackburn , Lanc@@ as@@ hire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
Inquiries revealed D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his w@@ all@@ et and on his credit cards .
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illic@@ itly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of S@@ carbo@@ rough as well as one of his associates .
All four suspects were being watch@@ ed by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and cocaine r@@ ack@@ et operating across Lanc@@ as@@ hire , Cum@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ shire and West Yor@@ k@@ shire .
They and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police seized hero@@ in and cocaine worth £ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than £ 200,000 in cash during a series of r@@ aids .
D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
Today at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court D@@ it@@ ta , who works at law firm For@@ bes Solic@@ itors , based in Blackburn , was facing dis@@ grace after being found guilty of two counts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court .
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing .
The lawyer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investigating S@@ carbo@@ rough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two detec@@ tives tr@@ ailed the suspect and spo@@ t@@ ted him arriving at D@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a p@@ urity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s b@@ ins in a black golf g@@ love .
So@@ on after the drop off , S@@ carbo@@ rough was in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Ro@@ vers football st@@ adium , E@@ wood Park .
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
The court heard D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , w@@ all@@ et and on his credit cards
D@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
During his arrest D@@ it@@ ta pic@@ ked up his w@@ all@@ et and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fo@@ m him .
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arrests to tell them what detec@@ tives knew about them .
Prosecu@@ ting , Anne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; If anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solic@@ itor . &quot;
Mr D@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal solic@@ itor , having become too involved with specific clients .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
But this went way beyond the ordinary confin@@ es of a lawyer @-@ client relationship .
He th@@ war@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ ouring his profession , but dis@@ hon@@ ouring it .
He got too close to certain clients , in particular S@@ carbo@@ rough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
D@@ it@@ ta denied wrong@@ doing and claimed : &quot; If I was a cor@@ rupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr S@@ carbo@@ rough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
But after the hearing Sup@@ t Lee Hal@@ stead from Lanc@@ as@@ hire Police said : &quot; Mr D@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal solic@@ itor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
His addiction to cocaine left him hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly compromised and vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
Solic@@ itors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should insti@@ l trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta has be@@ tr@@ ayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the ven@@ e@@ er of his profession .
Lanc@@ as@@ hire &apos;s Serious and Organ@@ ised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice , demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
We will find you and put you before the courts .

A@@ re@@ tha Franklin Back on Stage in December
According to Detroit News , the qu@@ een of Sou@@ l will be performing at the Sound Board hall of Mot@@ or@@ City Casino Hotel on 21 December .
Mrs Franklin has been busy in November recording an album for C@@ live Davis and Sony Music , produced by Don Was and Kenn@@ y &quot; Bab@@ y@@ face &quot; Edmon@@ ds .
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from , the star perform@@ er of &quot; Respect &quot; confirmed to the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were &quot; difficult &quot; to deal with .
She said she was &quot; happy to be back &quot; .
M@@ enton Re@@ duces Cost of Christmas L@@ ights
With 420 pat@@ tern@@ ed designs and 2.2 kilome@@ ters of se@@ a@@ front drap@@ ed in a man@@ tle of light , the bill for the illumin@@ ations in M@@ enton could give you a bit of a shock .
What &apos;s more , unlike in many communes , the bill is met by taxpayers rather than by business associations .
The town has decided to use LE@@ Ds to reduce costs .
There has also been a change in the management of the public lighting network and Christmas decor@@ ations .
Los Angeles Airport E@@ vacu@@ ated After Sho@@ oting
There was a shooting in Los Angeles International Airport .
A man opened fire at 10@@ am local time .
At least two people were injured , according to local police .

Class@@ ical Sing@@ ing for Te@@ en@@ agers
The student body has , each time , been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season .
Te@@ en@@ agers have been given the chance to get to gri@@ ps with classical sing@@ ing through five short plays created and performed by regional artists - performances containing a large dose of hum@@ our .
Besides this show , the Société d &apos;@@ Art Ly@@ rique du Royaume will be bringing back &quot; Destin@@ ations Ly@@ riques &quot; , a program that has been a crow@@ d @-@ pul@@ ler at La Pul@@ per@@ ie in Chic@@ ou@@ tim@@ i .
Two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014 , giving regional artists the chance to show what they are capable of .
In addition to these events , there was the Ap@@ éro Ly@@ rique , the benefit concert held last August , with the support of color@@ at@@ ura s@@ op@@ ran@@ o , Marie @-@ E@@ ve Mun@@ ger .
This , in parallel with the artistic dimension , was a benefit event which helps the non @-@ profit organisation achieve financial balance @-@ sheet that sounds as so@@ oth@@ ing to the ear as a tune from Die Fle@@ der@@ m@@ aus .
Without giving precise figures , the Chairperson of the Board of Directors , Yves Berg@@ eron , used the press conference held at Chic@@ ou@@ tim@@ i yesterday to give assurances .
Despite the prec@@ arious situation that so many cultural institutions face , the future looks bright , even in the long term .
We have more solid and stable support .
&quot; Finances are on an even ke@@ el and we hope to see the 50th anniversary of the oper@@ etta , a milestone we will reach in seven years , &quot; the administrator re@@ marked .
&quot; I would even say beyond that , &quot; added the general manager , Hel@@ ene Gau@@ dre@@ ault , with a s@@ mile .
A 38 @-@ year @-@ old man who took a child ho@@ stage at the Gabri@@ elle Roy school in Surrey is facing six charges , according to the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada .
O@@ mar Mou@@ st@@ ap@@ ha Hassan stands accused of ho@@ stage @-@ taking , ho@@ stage @-@ holding , making of verbal threats , carrying a weapon with dangerous intent , abduction and failure to follow an order .
&quot; The fast response by the police officer involved and their ability to def@@ use the situation immediately were critical to the safe ending of this incident , &quot; said L@@ ance Corporal B@@ ert P@@ aqu@@ et in a press release .
O@@ mar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday .
New Class Action Claim Against Holy Cross Bro@@ thers
A new class action claim has been filed against the brothers of the Cong@@ reg@@ ation of the Holy Cross involving sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts , allegedly carried out , this time , at the Saint @-@ Joseph Or@@ atory and several orph@@ an@@ ages , colleges and schools .
The claim is based on the testimony of an applicant identified as &quot; J. J &quot; , who would have been mas@@ turb@@ ated in the 19@@ 50s , first at Notre @-@ Dame @-@ des @-@ Ne@@ ig@@ es by his teacher , Bro@@ ther Sou@@ mis , then by his conf@@ essor , Father Bernard , at the Saint @-@ Joseph Or@@ atory , where he was an al@@ tar boy and where his father worked as a pain@@ ter .
&quot; The first action involved only three institutions , and when the ruling was announced , many people said to us : &apos; I was ass@@ aul@@ ted at so and so place , can I add my name ? &quot; says lawyer Alain Arsen@@ ault , who is defending the victims in the two actions .
The class action that has just been filed specifically enables the inclusion of plainti@@ ffs from any institution where members of the Cong@@ reg@@ ation of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses .
Currently , the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been ass@@ aul@@ ted by the brothers of the Holy Cross .
The alleged de@@ eds generally took place before those cited in the first action as many of the institutions concerned were closed in the 1960s .
Moreover , the action specifies that the Cong@@ reg@@ ation of the Holy Cross and the Saint @-@ Joseph Or@@ atory , which is a separate entity , &quot; allowed acts of sexual abuse to be committed against children &quot; , that they &quot; exercised moral , religious and psychological constraint over the victims , &quot; and that they &quot; knew about sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts committed but kept quiet &quot; and &quot; deliberately and consci@@ ously chose to ignore the problem &quot; .
The latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers of the Holy Cross , Mr E@@ mile Per@@ rin QC , in the 1990s , as well as through research carried out in the archives on this subject by Bro@@ ther Wilson Kennedy , a former brother of the Holy Cross who has publicly den@@ ounced the abuses .
The class action must first be deemed admissible by the Superior Court .
Once the Court has declared it admissible , it will proceed to the second stage , the preliminary hearings .
In the first action , the Cong@@ reg@@ ation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hearings were conducted .
Serious Fire in Shop
A fire caused serious damaged to a shop in the La@@ Salle district of Montreal on Thursday night .
The emergency services were called at around 1@@ am on Friday for a fire which had broken out in the bas@@ ement of an Indian restaurant on Doll@@ ard Avenue , near the junction with Rue Re@@ jan@@ e .
It tool the thirty @-@ something fire@@ fighters who r@@ ush@@ ed to the scene almost an hour to bring the fl@@ ames under control .
The fire &quot; caused significant damage to the structure of the building &quot; , said the chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Department , Richard Bor@@ deaux .
The cause of the fire is unknown , however there was no@@ body in the restaurant when the fire@@ fighters arrived on the scene .
There were no casualties , but close to twenty fl@@ ats on the first and second floors of this row of shops had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated .
The Red Cross was called in given that the residents of one of the apartments might need temporary accommodation , according to the Fire Department .
Great Opposition to Med@@ ically @-@ Ass@@ isted Death at P@@ alli@@ ative Care Congress
The Canadian P@@ alli@@ ative Care Congress , holding in Ottawa this week , comes several days after the vote in favour of the bill on medic@@ ally @-@ assisted death in Quebec .
Several palli@@ ative care associations used the opportunity to rest@@ ate their dis@@ approval .
&quot; If every ill person had access to effective care to reli@@ eve their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would wish to end their lives , &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ person for the Canadian P@@ alli@@ ative Care Association , Mary@@ se B@@ ouv@@ ette .
&quot; If emphasis was put on palli@@ ative care in Canada , the call for eu@@ than@@ asia would become minimal , &quot; she added .
The Chairperson of the Quebec P@@ alli@@ ative Care Network also re@@ jects the bill on medic@@ ally @-@ assisted death .
Alber@@ te D@@ ér@@ y is concerned about the consequences for future generations if it is adopted .
&quot; What is the meaning of life ? &quot; she l@@ aments .
The majority of palli@@ ative care homes will refuse to help patients die , according to the vice @-@ president of the Alliance of P@@ alli@@ ative Care H@@ omes , Suzanne Fitz@@ back .
Mrs Fitz@@ back , who is also the director of the Mathieu @-@ Fro@@ ment @-@ S@@ avoie Home in Gatineau , th@@ inks the service would be us@@ eless any@@ way .
&quot; Nob@@ ody ever says to us : &apos; I want to die , give me an injection . &quot;
The director of the P@@ alli@@ ative Care Association of Ontario , Rick Fir@@ th , believes that the Quebec bill is conf@@ using people with regard to the purpose of palli@@ ative care .
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit .
Meanwhile , the liberal MP of Gatineau , Steph@@ anie Val@@ lee , th@@ inks that the concept of termination of life needs to be clarified before the bill can be adopted .
Ken@@ yan press outr@@ aged at controversial media law
&quot; It is a f@@ righ@@ tening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply swe@@ eping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; This law is dr@@ ac@@ onian and very puni@@ tive and we reject it , &quot; said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Capit@@ al@@ FM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
He said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs , &quot; he said .
According to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot; dealt a major b@@ low &quot; and lam@@ bas@@ ted the bill as &quot; dr@@ ac@@ onian . &quot;
The passing of the bill comes am@@ id a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islam@@ ist gun@@ men on the West@@ gate shopping m@@ all .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were dispat@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ portedly rob@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all .
Police chief David Kim@@ ai@@ yo re@@ acted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for questioning , although the sum@@ mons was re@@ tracted following a media out@@ cr@@ y .
Under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ illings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de @-@ listed , &quot; or bar@@ red from receiving official press accreditation .
The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid .
According to the Daily Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to crip@@ ple most FM stations . &quot;
It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; li@@ vely blo@@ go@@ sphere . &quot;
By sil@@ encing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity .
&quot; No one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist M@@ ut@@ uma Mathi@@ u , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
&quot; Le@@ ft to themselves , politicians would bank@@ rupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .
Ken@@ yan law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past .
In May they voted to over@@ turn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinst@@ ate their he@@ f@@ ty salaries of around 53@@ 2,000 sh@@ illings a month tax @-@ free - ranked among the highest in the world .
Difficul@@ t Year for Pharmac@@ ists
The departure of almost 10 pharmac@@ ists from the Centre for Health and Social Services ( CS@@ SS ) in Laval has caused tur@@ mo@@ il amid@@ st the managers of the Cité @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Santé hospital in the year 2012 @-@ 2013 .
The pharm@@ acy department has been left seriously short @-@ staffed following multiple depart@@ ures due to retirement , maternity leave or , simply , re@@ sign@@ ations .
There is a staff shortage of almost 30 % , making the financial year &quot; very difficult &quot; according to department head , G@@ illi@@ an Beau@@ det .
Even so , the CS@@ SS has decided not to employ independent labour , which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full @-@ time pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; We didn &apos;t resort to a stop @-@ gap solution , &quot; explained Beau@@ det .
&quot; We consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place .
We clearly worked hard on trying to persu@@ ade our young &#91; pharm@@ acy residents &#93; to come and stay here .
A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year . &quot;
Improved situation
After this difficult period , 2013 @-@ 2014 looks like a definitely easier one for the pharm@@ acy department at the CS@@ SS .
Three pharmac@@ ists have already returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to hold on to staff have paid off , as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay on at the CS@@ SS .
&quot; Th@@ ings are going much better now , &quot; stressed the pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three back from maternity leave .
So that will fill the gaps we had last year . &quot;
Need still growing
However , the situation is still prec@@ arious .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmac@@ ists in hospitals or a predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
&quot; For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is always prec@@ arious as this is a young environment where a lot of young women are being employed . So in terms of pregn@@ ancies , you can always count on three people being on maternity leave when things are going well , &quot; she added .
&quot; Last year there were many more and there were no pharmac@@ ists available to replace them , so it was more difficult . &quot;

CG@@ R Theatre in N@@ arb@@ onne E@@ vacu@@ ated on Thursday E@@ ven@@ ing
The first showing of a film at the Meg@@ a CG@@ R theatre in N@@ arb@@ onne was interrupted on Thursday evening out of precau@@ tion after viewers reported a tin@@ gl@@ ing sens@@ ation in the thro@@ at .
The theatre director immediately began an evacuation procedure and called the fire brigade to check out a suspicious sm@@ ell .
Around 70 people were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the viewing .
They were examined , and a thorough check of the cin@@ ema revealed nothing .
Was it a bad jo@@ ke involving te@@ ar gas ?
Or was it an invol@@ un@@ tary incident ?
E@@ ither way , the management of the theatre decided to implement the principle of precau@@ tion and put the safety of its customers first .
The cin@@ ema was ventil@@ ated and everyone returned in good order .
The cin@@ ema was able to show itself in a good light and the customers could continue enjoying events un@@ fol@@ ding ...

W@@ oman Tri@@ es S@@ mu@@ ggling 2@@ kg of Coc@@ aine In@@ side P@@ um@@ p@@ kins
Taking advantage of Hal@@ lo@@ ween , a woman tried to smu@@ gg@@ le two kil@@ os of cocaine hidden inside pu@@ mp@@ kins into the country through Montreal @-@ Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning .
The drugs were detected when passenger lu@@ ggage was checked .
The cocaine was split between three pu@@ mp@@ kins that had been previously hol@@ low@@ ed out .
The drugs were subsequently taken to the office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada ( GRC ) , which then took over the investigation .
The Canada Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) did not reveal where the woman had been travelling from when she was intercep@@ ted .
&quot; That is part of the investigation , &quot; indicated J@@ acqu@@ eline Ro@@ by , spo@@ kes@@ person for the CBSA .
&quot; What I can tell you is that she was entering the country . &quot;
Since the start of 2013 , the Canada Border Services Agency at Montreal @-@ Trudeau Airport has conducted 173 drugs seizures , of which 10 involved seizures of cocaine tot@@ aling 44 kilogram@@ s .
In 2012 the Border Services Agency for the province of Quebec made 1,6@@ 53 seizures of nar@@ cotics .
Air R@@ aid Against Military Installations in Syria
Israeli air@@ crafts entered Lebanese air space early on Wednesday afternoon , but did not carry out attacks until the evening , according to the Lebanese army .
A cargo of short range SA @-@ 8 ground @-@ to @-@ air missiles was targeted and destroyed .
This latest r@@ aid by the Israeli air force in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the start of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper , Ha@@ a@@ ret@@ z ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor Syria .
The r@@ aid took place under circumstances almost identical to that of July 5 : on that occasion , it was also an un@@ named American official who confirmed to CN@@ N an Israeli attack that targeted Y@@ akh@@ ont ground @-@ to @-@ air missiles supplied to Dam@@ asc@@ us by Russia .
Israeli officials made no attempt to hide their anger when Washington revealed the attack , at the risk of forcing President Ass@@ ad to respond .
Ukraine Close to Economic Coll@@ apse
Rating agency , Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , reduced Ukraine &apos;s credit rating on Friday , casting a doubt on the ability of the former Soviet re@@ public , which has been in recession for a year , to meet its financial obligations .
The government debt rating moved to B@@ - , further down into the category of spec@@ ulative investments .
This rating is accompanied by a negative outlook , with S &amp; P seeing at least one chance in three that it will down@@ grade the rating again in the next year .
&quot; It is increasingly unlikely that the government &apos;s strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments , &quot; explained the American agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine &apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and the trend is expected to continue .
This complic@@ ates the repayment of credit from abroad .
These reserves , which the authorities have had to use extensively to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , are coll@@ ap@@ sing , leading to the agency considering de@@ valuation more and more likely , which would infl@@ ate the country &apos;s foreign debt .
Moreover , Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia , which acc@@ uses it of not having paid a bill of 8@@ 82 million dollars .
The announcement comes as bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of serious tension with its Russian neighb@@ our , which is fur@@ ious with Kiev &apos;s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
This was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has explo@@ ded in recent years . S &amp; P estimates it as 3@@ 3.5 % of the GDP , as opposed to 10 % prior to the crisis of 2008 @-@ 2009 .
Experi@@ encing a budgetary deficit , the country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months . The latter , in 2010 , had given the former a 15,@@ 300 million dollars loan , but this time it has released just 3,@@ 400 million .
The IMF is refusing to pay any further install@@ ments until the country has adopted un@@ popular reforms to reduce its deficit , especially by increasing the price of gas for the population .
Following a fruit@@ less mission to the country , the IMF noted this week that &quot; the significant need for external finance &quot; represented &quot; a weakness &quot; , even though there were &quot; signs of economic improvement &quot; .
However , for the econom@@ ist , O@@ le@@ k@@ sand@@ r J@@ ol@@ ou@@ d , from the Centre for Political Studies , &quot; no improvement can be expected in the short term &quot; .
&quot; There is little hope of un@@ popular reforms being made in a pre @-@ election year , &quot; said the expert in an AF@@ P interview . Presidential elections are planned for 2015 .
The only hope is for an improvement in international circumstances .
S &amp; P notes , furthermore , the &quot; uncertainty &quot; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which for Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition leader Y@@ uli@@ a Timo@@ chen@@ ko .
&quot; Sign@@ ing the agreement would be good for business in the long term , but it might have negative consequences in the short term in relation to Russia &apos;s reaction , &quot; explained S &amp; P , which is concerned Moscow may introduce &quot; trade restrictions &quot; .
Russia , which is responsible for a quarter of Ukrainian exports , has war@@ ned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev , it will have to reinforce its border controls for imported goods .
US Green @-@ lights Public@@ is @-@ Om@@ nic@@ om M@@ erg@@ er
Public@@ is and Om@@ nic@@ om said on Friday that they had not received any objection from the American authorities to their plans to mer@@ ge , thus bringing closer the creation of the world &apos;s biggest advertising agency .
The merger brings together the world &apos;s second largest agency , Om@@ nic@@ om , and the third largest , Public@@ is .
&quot; The Om@@ nic@@ om Group and Public@@ is Group today announced the expiry of the period of investigation into the previously announced merger of the Public@@ is Group and Om@@ nic@@ om , under the H@@ art @-@ Scott @-@ Ro@@ din@@ o Anti@@ trust Improvements Act of 1976 , as amended , &quot; the two groups announced in a press release .
They specified that they had also received the necessary author@@ isations from Canada , India and Turkey , in addition to those from South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the period of investigation provided for by the H@@ SR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy many of the conditions necessary for the move to take place .
&quot; The merger is also conditional upon obtaining other regulatory author@@ isations and the approval of the two groups &apos; shareholders , &quot; they add .
Congolese Army Hun@@ ts D@@ own M@@ 23 Reb@@ els
The Congolese army ( FAR@@ DC ) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M@@ 23 reb@@ els right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu , which borders Rwanda and Uganda .
The M@@ 23 appears to be on the ver@@ ge of defe@@ at , having been driven out of the towns in the nor@@ theast of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( RDC ) , which it had been in control of since the start of the u@@ pris@@ ing 20 months ago .
&quot; We will pursue the M@@ 23 and drive it out of wherever it is hi@@ ding because they are criminals , &quot; Colonel Oli@@ vier Ham@@ ul@@ i , spo@@ kes@@ man for the FAR@@ DC , declared to R@@ eu@@ ters .
&quot; We must not allow them to regrou@@ p because they have been making the Congolese people suffer for too long .
The time has come for peace to be restored . &quot;
Leaders of the M@@ 23 say they ev@@ acu@@ ated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ trand Bis@@ im@@ wa , political leader of the re@@ bel@@ lion , asserted on R@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would not change its demands at the peace talks in any way .
According to the U@@ gan@@ dan medi@@ ators , talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M@@ 23 resumed in K@@ amp@@ ala on Wednesday , .
Sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes were reported in the h@@ ills above Bun@@ ag@@ ana , the last town in the hands of the reb@@ els to fall this week , and around R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a hill where the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion started in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insurg@@ ents occupied G@@ oma , the capital of the province of North Kivu , taking advantage of the ret@@ reat of the government gar@@ rison and the in@@ action of the Mon@@ us@@ co blue ber@@ ets .
The fall of G@@ oma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the largest in the world in terms of numbers , to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intervention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa , Malawi and Tanzania .
Meanwhile , FAR@@ DC staff has been res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led and the army has gone on the offensive against the M@@ 23 , changing the course of the war .
The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented .
&quot; The M@@ 23 seems to be ne@@ aring its end , &quot; predicted an expert in Congolese affairs , Jason Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blog Congo Si@@ asa .
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in qu@@ ash@@ ing a major insur@@ rection .
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group alli@@ ed to Rwanda present in the east of the RDC .
United Nations experts acc@@ use Rwanda of providing military support to the M@@ 23 , which has initially made up of mu@@ tin@@ ous former Congolese soldiers . Rwanda ve@@ h@@ ement@@ ly den@@ ies this .
The British Foreign Secretary , William Hague , called on the Rwandan President Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , a Foreign Office spo@@ kes@@ man announced .
Last week , K@@ ig@@ ali raised the possibility of military ret@@ ali@@ ation after sh@@ ells landed in Rwandan territory .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of Bun@@ ag@@ ana took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of the FAR@@ DC troops .
&quot; We have been living with the M@@ 23 for a year and it seemed un@@ imagin@@ able that we would one day be fre@@ ed by the army , &quot; said an in@@ habitant of the town on the border with Uganda .
&quot; We have been living in terror &#91; of the M@@ 23 &#93; , we are trau@@ mati@@ sed , &quot; the man added .
Tests carried out by the Pas@@ teur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coron@@ avir@@ us turned out negative , the Ministry of Health has announced .
It specified that &quot; the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only confirmed cases in France to date . &quot;
The 43 @-@ year @-@ old patient had been suspected of being infected on Tuesday , after returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia , where the disease has already killed about fifty people .
Chev@@ ron , the second largest oil company in America , announced a drop in quarterly profits on Friday , as a result of a reduction in its refining margins , although its production of oil and gas increased while still being below the group &apos;s target .
Its net profit for the third quarter went down to $ 4,@@ 950 million , or $ 2.@@ 57 per share , as opposed to $ 5,@@ 250 million , or $ 2.@@ 69 per share , the previous year .
Analy@@ sts questioned by R@@ eu@@ ters were counting on an average profit of $ 2.@@ 71 per share .
The group produced 2.@@ 59 million oil @-@ equivalent bar@@ rels per day during the course of the quarter , an increase compared to the 2.@@ 52 million bar@@ rels per day produced a year before .
The company is targeting 2.@@ 65 million bar@@ rels per day for this year , with an increase of 25 % in production planned by 20@@ 17 .
The majority of the growth in the years to come will come from its li@@ que@@ fied natural gas schemes in Australia .
Because of the cost of these schemes , annual investment costs have gone up by seven thousand million dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36,@@ 700 million dollars in 2013 .
The profits from production activities went down slightly in the third quarter , while profits from downstream activities ( including refining and chemical production ) fell 45 % to 380 million dollars .
The reduction in refining margins is affecting the entire sector .
Chev@@ ron &apos;s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ x@@ on , also announced a drop in net profits on Thursday , despite an increase in its gas and oil production .
School Transport : Complaint Judg@@ ed Ad@@ missible
Since the beginning of the academic year , the Sherbrooke Region School Board ( CS@@ RS ) has been demanding a $ 150 fee per student ( to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for students using school transport to get to two addresses , a service that the organisation offers when it is able to .
No financial contribution had been demanded prior to the changes made to the last budget .
&quot; The Board proposed a mediation service and I was interested , &quot; says Mrs Le@@ f@@ ev@@ re .
According to her , the CS@@ RS was invited to a mediation and she asked for an additional period for consideration .
&quot; It is always better to discuss , consult and find solutions such issues , &quot; Mrs Le@@ f@@ ev@@ re believes .
The Sherbrooke Region School Board ( CS@@ RS ) did not wish to comment on the issue .
The organisation merely indicated that the mediation was part of a process arising from a complaint .
Ro@@ w Over Clo@@ sure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel @-@ Dieu
In light of the re@@ bel@@ lion that has been running for several months involving a section of the staff and several unions , including the CG@@ T , the Minister of Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol Tour@@ aine , decided on July 10 to &quot; put back the schedule for implementing the project and , in particular , the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4 &quot; .
This was an official request made so as &quot; not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter &quot; , but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party &apos;s campaign a few months before local elections .
Despite the minister &apos;s instructions , the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on this date .
At the AP@@ HP , officials prefer the term &quot; transformation &quot; or &quot; change in continuity &quot; to closure .
From November 4 , the units of the fire brigade , which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel @-@ Dieu each year , will all have received instructions to take their about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris .
November 4 is also the day on which hospital training re@@ su@@ mes .
At the Hôtel @-@ Dieu , inter@@ ns speci@@ alising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine inter@@ ns on Monday .
The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month .
&quot; The Hôtel @-@ Dieu emergency service has to close as soon as possible , and for us , that &apos;s November 4 , &quot; Lo@@ ï@@ c Cap@@ ron , the chairperson of the medical committee ( C@@ ME ) at the AP@@ HP which supports the management project , says straight@@ for@@ w@@ ard@@ ly .
&quot; On November 4 , patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade , there will only be people arriving by their own means , &quot; confirms Professor Jean @-@ Yves F@@ agon , chief medical officer at the new Hôtel @-@ Dieu .
&quot; However , we will continue accepting emergency cases , &quot; he temper@@ s , emphas@@ ising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases .
&quot; Senior emergency doctors will remain on site , &quot; he also ass@@ ures .
But the decision to close the emergency service resi@@ des with the regional health agency ( ARS ) .
&quot; Th@@ ings are moving gradually , &quot; says Nicolas Pé@@ j@@ u , spo@@ kes@@ man for the ARS , for whom &quot; there will be no change in terms of the service offered &quot; , come November 4 .
&quot; The minister has either li@@ ed to us or has been li@@ ed to , &quot; l@@ aments emergency medical officer , Gér@@ ald Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
Dis@@ missed from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the re@@ organisation project , he defines himself as a &quot; wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ b@@ lower &quot; in the face of a &quot; cy@@ n@@ ical &quot; decision taken by the &quot; technical medical administration body &quot; .
&quot; They are in the process of aband@@ oning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago , &quot; he believes .
For him , &quot; if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus , there w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be a problem . &quot;
But they are regularly saturated .
For example , there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at L@@ ari@@ bo@@ isi@@ ère .
The ARS stresses that thirty patients &quot; des@@ pat@@ ched &quot; to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an &quot; aval@@ anche &quot; for the other emergency services , where human resources would have been reinforced any@@ way .
The ARS , like the AP@@ HP , is defending the &quot; new hospital model &quot; which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35@@ ,000 patients a year .
By the end of the year , self @-@ employed G@@ Ps are also expected to participate in the implementation of an &quot; ambul@@ atory care service &quot; .
&quot; Where are we heading if we start asking people to self @-@ diagno@@ se ? &quot; asks Gér@@ ald Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek , for whom &quot; the concept of a non @-@ major emergency &quot; is &quot; dangerous &quot; and marks a &quot; medical step back@@ wards &quot; .
&quot; The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units .
People are not stu@@ pi@@ d , they will go wherever the best care is offered . &quot;
&quot; If the minister does not take a step by Monday , we will take a different approach , &quot; war@@ ns Christop@@ he P@@ ru@@ d@@ homme , emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CG@@ T .
&quot; We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list . &quot;
In Nath@@ alie Ko@@ sci@@ us@@ ko @-@ M@@ oriz@@ et &apos;s team , Vincent Roger , a UM@@ P coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in Paris and MP of the 4th arron@@ dissement , states clearly that &quot; even if the UM@@ P in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel @-@ Dieu , it would be technically and financially impossible to re@@ open them if you look at the duties . &quot;
Ann H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the Socialist Party &apos;s candidate , repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4 .
If it went ahead , she would register her clear disagreement , stresses Bruno Ju@@ illard , her spo@@ kes@@ man .
&quot; Even though the re@@ organisation of the Hôtel @-@ Dieu has an underlying justification , we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals . &quot;
Obama En@@ ds Sp@@ ying on IMF and World Bank
Bar@@ ack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to stop t@@ apping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities , said an American official on Thursday .
This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the N@@ SA phone @-@ t@@ apping aff@@ air following re@@ vel@@ ations by the former analy@@ st , Edward Snow@@ den , who has taken refuge in Russia .
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scand@@ al .
When asked about this , an official of the American administration replied : &quot; The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank and IMF in Washington . &quot;
Tal@@ king under the clo@@ ak of anony@@ m@@ ity , the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past .
Another official indicated that Bar@@ ack Obama had given the order to stop these practices during recent weeks .
The instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone @-@ t@@ apping of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this regard , the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday , but still authorised them to proceed .
The committee introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence services were authorised to collect and imposed a limit of five years on the length of time they could hold such data .
UN h@@ ails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplom@@ ats played a key role in push@@ ing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the MDGs , which expire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight .
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms G@@ illard during the summit .
UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - S@@ DGs , &quot; he said .
These S@@ DGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to re@@ alise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs .
Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities cl@@ ash
With a statue of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , Mozambique &apos;s founding president , st@@ aring down on them , thousands of people gathered in central M@@ apu@@ to to chant peace slog@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; We want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said Van@@ ess@@ a de Sou@@ sa , chief executive of an investment company .
F@@ ear@@ ful about the future of her country , she sw@@ apped her corporate attire for a T @-@ shir@@ t emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capital &apos;s Independence Square on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of cl@@ ashes between government forces and Ren@@ am@@ o , some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
Ren@@ am@@ o was once a notori@@ ous rebel movement , initially backed by white @-@ ruled Rho@@ des@@ ia and then South Africa &apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to des@@ t@@ abil@@ ise the country &apos;s independent government .
After a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
Analy@@ sts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full @-@ b@@ low@@ n conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and loc@@ als .
The st@@ akes are high for the fast @-@ growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $ 50@@ bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale of Brazil , En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko of the US .
The ruling Fre@@ lim@@ o party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Ren@@ am@@ o bl@@ ame each other for the tension .
Ren@@ am@@ o says the government initiated the latest cl@@ ashes by launching an attack on its members in So@@ f@@ ala province , traditionally a Ren@@ am@@ o str@@ on@@ gh@@ old , on October 17 .
Ass@@ aul@@ ts on the former reb@@ els then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked Ren@@ am@@ o bases and attempted to kill A@@ fonso D@@ hl@@ ak@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , Fern@@ ando Maz@@ anga , Ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , told the Financial Times .
The government bl@@ ames Ren@@ am@@ o for trigg@@ ering the cl@@ ashes , acc@@ using it of att@@ acking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told AF@@ P , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr D@@ hl@@ ak@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; lo@@ ser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
Both Fre@@ lim@@ o and Ren@@ am@@ o ins@@ ist they want to avoid war .
But concerns have grown after Mr Maz@@ anga was quoted as saying Ren@@ am@@ o was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace accord .
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Fre@@ lim@@ o .
&quot; Our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seriousness , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fu@@ elled by a series of cl@@ ashes this year .
&quot; It &apos;s two big men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ hl@@ ak@@ ama ) bu@@ tting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Han@@ lon , a l@@ ectu@@ rer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .
Neither of them are good negoti@@ ators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
Ren@@ am@@ o , which has been push@@ ing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boy@@ cott municipal elections due in November .
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year .
Some comment@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
Ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a new@@ er party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former Ren@@ am@@ o member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Maz@@ anga says Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; He does not want multi @-@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
It is unclear how much capacity Ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has carried out disrup@@ tive hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north @-@ south highway .
Most of the sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes have taken place in So@@ f@@ ala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of M@@ apu@@ to , but hosts Be@@ ira , the port that min@@ ers , including Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , rely on to export coal .
In June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Ren@@ am@@ o threatened to attack the line .
Mr Maz@@ anga was co@@ y when asked about whether Ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
Ren@@ am@@ o wanted to &quot; war@@ n the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique , &quot; Mr Maz@@ anga said .
The instability has added to frustr@@ ations with the government , says Fern@@ ando Lima , head of Medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
O@@ mar Sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demon@@ strat@@ or , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; No one car@@ es about Ren@@ am@@ o and Fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
Children should be taught my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as &quot; models for a way of life &quot; , author says .
T@@ ales of Th@@ or could show &quot; brute strength is no match for sub@@ tle tric@@ k@@ ery , &quot; while the Arth@@ ur@@ ian leg@@ ends reveal the importance of having a dream .
S@@ aying many of the my@@ ths would be &quot; far too wild , far too scand@@ al@@ ous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; Cross@@ ley @-@ Holland advocated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age @-@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ th and folklore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
I have been advoc@@ ating it as a plan for twenty years .
He added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly didacti@@ c &quot; is a &quot; total switch @-@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; sub@@ limin@@ ated &quot; in enjoy@@ able stories .
Cross@@ ley @-@ Holland , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from Angl@@ o @-@ S@@ ax@@ on as well as writing the Pen@@ gu@@ in Book of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Fol@@ k T@@ ales , said : &quot; You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an in@@ n@@ ate sense of good and evi@@ l .
And that must be sub@@ limin@@ ated ; revealed through a story rather than stated .
The old basis of showing not telling .
A figh@@ ter of Hamas &apos; armed wing was killed this evening and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip , medical and security sources in Gaza report .
According to these sources , the activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel , when they were sh@@ elled by an Israeli tank .
N@@ SA Sp@@ ying : The United States &quot; went too far , &quot; Ker@@ ry ad@@ mits
The United States sometimes went &quot; too far &quot; with its es@@ pion@@ age activities , Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry recognised in the first admission from Washington , which is deep in contro@@ vers@@ y with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scand@@ al , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the United States and its European allies , this is the first time that an official of the American government has explicitly admitted controversial activities in the N@@ SA &apos;s interception of communications and data in Europe .
&quot; In certain cases , I acknowledge , as does the President , that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future , &quot; declared John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington via a video link on Thursday October 31 .
In his rel@@ ayed speech , and in the presence of his British counterpart , William Hague , the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks .
C@@ iting the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured that the American authorities had since th@@ war@@ ted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data .
&quot; We have prevented planes being brought down , buildings being b@@ low@@ n up and people being mur@@ dered , because we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks , &quot; the head of the American diplomatic service argued .
Furthermore , John Ker@@ ry stated in his address to the Europeans , &quot; I assure you that no innocent person has been mis@@ led during this process . &quot;
Yet America stri@@ ves to coll@@ ate data .
&quot; Yes , in certain cases , this went too far in an inappropriate manner , &quot; the Secretary of State again admitted , having already had to make a statement on the international scand@@ al during a tour in Paris , London and Rome last week .
On Thursday evening , he asserted that President Obama had &quot; resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re @-@ examination of these practices to ensure that no @-@ one felt mis@@ led &quot; .
But the contro@@ vers@@ y between the Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Post , the N@@ SA has been intercep@@ ting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Ya@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which quotes documents obtained by the former N@@ SA consultant , Edward Snow@@ den , stated that the programme du@@ b@@ bed &quot; MU@@ SC@@ UL@@ AR &quot; and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the N@@ SA , the G@@ CH@@ Q , enabled the two agencies to gather data from the fibre @-@ op@@ tic cables used by Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on em@@ ails to text elements or audio and video files .
These inter@@ ceptions apparently took place outside the USA .
However , Ya@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any involvement in these practices .
For ten days now , a number of major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain and Italy have been reve@@ aling that the N@@ SA had intercep@@ ted massive quantities of data and communications eman@@ ating from allies of the United States and their leaders , in particular the German Chancell@@ or Angela Mer@@ kel .
Following the ou@@ trage of the European states , and even though le@@ aks to the American press stated that the American President was not up @-@ to @-@ date with these sp@@ ying activities , Bar@@ ack Obama has refused to comment on the matter , citing national security .
On the other hand , the head of the powerful N@@ SA , General Keith Alexander , denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even pointed the fin@@ ger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the N@@ SA .
This concerned &quot; military operations &quot; in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe , according to General Alexander .
The dis@@ cord spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia sum@@ mon@@ ed the Australian ambass@@ ador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international es@@ pion@@ age network , which has also arou@@ sed the ire of China .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will face L@@ ori@@ ent on Friday without its tr@@ ump card , the Swe@@ de Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ o@@ vic , who is suffering from an injury , the Ligue 1 club announced in a press release .
PS@@ G , who are top of the le@@ ague ahead of Monaco on goal difference , issued the team sheet for the match , which is the 12th of the season , on which the 32 @-@ year @-@ old stri@@ ker did not appear .
The press release said only that he is &quot; injured &quot; , without saying what the injury was .
However , he was suffering from an inflammation on the left k@@ nee following his return from international duty this month .
Cerem@@ ony in Mem@@ ory of the C@@ rem@@ ated
The Père Lach@@ aise cre@@ mat@@ orium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11@@ am in memory of all those cre@@ m@@ ated at the establishment this year .
Anne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , soci@@ alist candidate for Paris may@@ orship , is expected to attend and will later explain her proposals on fun@@ er@@ ary matters at a press conference .
Click above to watch the ceremony .
More and more French people are choosing cre@@ mation for their own fun@@ erals rather than in@@ hum@@ ation - 53 % against 47 % , according to an I@@ p@@ sos survey carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1,@@ 009 people .
It is the opposite for the fun@@ eral of a loved one - the French prefer in@@ hum@@ ation ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
Only 15 % of those who lose a child choose cre@@ mation .
In his book , La M@@ ort en C@@ end@@ res , D@@ ami@@ en Le Gu@@ ay , philos@@ op@@ her and vice @-@ chairperson of the Comité National d &apos;@@ Eth@@ ique du Fun@@ ér@@ aire emphas@@ ises the &quot; violence &quot; that cre@@ mation represents for those left behind .
With cre@@ mation , there is a sense of &quot; violence committed against the body of a loved one &quot; , which will be &quot; reduced to a pile of ashes &quot; in a very short time instead of after a process of decom@@ position that &quot; would accompany the stages of grief &quot; .
There is also a &quot; symbo@@ lic violence &quot; that relates to the &quot; ob@@ liter@@ ation of the person &apos;s sing@@ ul@@ arity and of distinctive symbols &quot; , which are reduced to the &quot; anony@@ m@@ ity &quot; of ashes .
Why is this accepted without difficulty in certain Nordic and prot@@ est@@ ant countries , but is still taken bad@@ ly in France ?
&quot; Because cre@@ mation is a recent development , &quot; says Marie @-@ Fré@@ dé@@ rique Bac@@ qué , president of the Than@@ at@@ ological Society and author of the book Ap@@ pri@@ vo@@ iser la M@@ ort .
The Catholic Church only started toler@@ ating it in 1963 , a fact that has restricted efforts at getting to gri@@ ps with it .
For François Mich@@ aud @-@ N@@ ér@@ ard , director general of Fun@@ er@@ ary Services for the City of Paris , getting to gri@@ ps with cre@@ mation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as di@@ gni@@ fied as it would have been with an in@@ hum@@ ation .
The annual I@@ p@@ sos survey shows the strength of attachment to the arrangement of the ceremony .
77 % of French want one for their loved ones , be it religious ( 53 % ) or civil ( 24 % ) .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , 73 % of people choosing cre@@ mation want a ceremony to be arranged .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non @-@ beli@@ e@@ vers also want one .
Cre@@ mat@@ oria have adapted to this change in society .
&quot; For a decade or so , they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in waiting for an hour and a half , doing nothing , followed immediately by their being handed the ashes , &quot; observes Mich@@ aud @-@ N@@ ér@@ ard .
70 % of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following rit@@ ual in the presence of the body : gre@@ et the cong@@ reg@@ ation , mention the deceased by name , connect the deceased to those present , e@@ vo@@ ke who the person was , give sense to their death , organise a fa@@ re@@ well .
This is what has been happening at the Père Lach@@ aise cre@@ mat@@ orium since 1998 .
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that , since 2010 , the Père Lach@@ aise cre@@ mat@@ orium has been organising a number of mem@@ orial ceremonies , lay and non @-@ religious , on All S@@ aints Day , to which it invites the families of all those who have been cre@@ m@@ ated during the course of the year .
For the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies has been rel@@ ayed online , for those could not attend .
The cre@@ mat@@ orium has authorised us to broadcast it .
Re@@ housing Due to R@@ ats C@@ auses Stri@@ fe in La Se@@ yne
At the start of this week , a family abandoned its ground floor apartment in building Fr@@ uc@@ ti@@ dor D2 because of the presence of rats .
In view of the urgency of the situation , the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional , provisional re@@ housing for the couple and their three children in a new four @-@ room house .
However , the family refused &quot; for financial reasons &quot; and the situation is at stal@@ em@@ ate .
&quot; The matter has become ex@@ agg@@ erated , &quot; th@@ inks Jo@@ ël Can@@ ap@@ a , office director .
&quot; There have always been rats in towns .
The rat ex@@ termination company conducts two operations per year . Furthermore , we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents .
Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter .
The area has not been abandoned and rats are not sw@@ arming into the town .
Due to environmental protection and public health concerns , rat ex@@ termination products are four times less efficient than in the past , but we are not going to kill a k@@ id for the sake of two rats . &quot;
&quot; We didn &apos;t invite the rats in , &quot; coun@@ ters the father of the family , which left its home and moved into a hotel .
&quot; We will soon be p@@ enn@@ il@@ ess and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one . &quot;

House Eng@@ ul@@ fed in Fl@@ ames in Old Quebec
A fire that started at mid@@ day on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control .
More than thirty fi@@ rem@@ en r@@ ush@@ ed to 9 Rue Hé@@ bert .
The fire started in a three @-@ apartment house on four floors , situated behind the yard of the Quebec Sem@@ inary .
All the tenants were out when the fire started .
The fire was brought under control an hour after the fi@@ rem@@ en who arrived in their numbers to intervene .
As soon as the first fi@@ rem@@ en arrived , they could clearly see the smoke .
&quot; The al@@ arms went off one after the other as it took rein@@ forc@@ ements to deal with the building , because the buildings here are close together , &quot; explained France Lo@@ is@@ elle , spo@@ kes@@ person for the Quebec fire service .
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire .
Ben Green@@ man : The T@@ enth Anniversary of the New York Com@@ edy Festival : The New Yor@@ ker
One could argue that New York City is the birth@@ place of stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ au@@ dev@@ illi@@ an Frank F@@ ay , who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre , on Broad@@ way , started telling jo@@ kes directly to the crow@@ d , in a convers@@ ational manner .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Com@@ edy Festival .
Created and over@@ seen by Caroline Hir@@ sch , the founder of the stan@@ du@@ p institution Carol@@ ines , the festival celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large the@@ atres .
&quot; Most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at Carol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hir@@ sch said .
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
This year &apos;s event includes appearances by W@@ anda Sy@@ kes , Kath@@ y Griff@@ in , and Bill Ma@@ her , as well as &quot; St@@ and Up for Her@@ oes , &quot; an annual music @-@ and @-@ com@@ edy benefit for military veterans , at Mad@@ ison Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bruce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Stewart , Roger Waters , and Bill Cos@@ by .
As the festival has expanded , so has the world of com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Com@@ edy Central , F@@ X , and Spi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ roll rose to promin@@ ence on a deep @-@ cable sit@@ com ( F@@ XX &apos;s g@@ le@@ efully ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y fant@@ asy @-@ football @-@ them@@ ed &quot; The League &quot; ) and now has his own Com@@ edy Central sket@@ ch show .

Both K@@ roll and S@@ late , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinctive voices ( the sur@@ really p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic Anthony Jes@@ el@@ nik , the w@@ ry , raci@@ ally focussed W. Kam@@ au Bell ) , are products of the decentralized world of American com@@ edy .
One of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg talking to Larry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edi@@ an but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an un@@ official com@@ edy histori@@ an .
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot; S@@ it D@@ own Com@@ edy with David Ste@@ in@@ berg . &quot;
The meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&quot; The city is definitely in the com@@ edy DNA of all of Larry &apos;s work , &quot; Ste@@ in@@ berg said .
He was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;ll walk down an al@@ ley between two buildings and think to himself , He@@ y , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;ll live here .
Oil extends drop toward $ 96 a bar@@ rel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China &apos;s power @-@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector is strengthening .
B@@ ench@@ mark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ rel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange .
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday , leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October .
A@@ mp@@ le supplies of crude have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million bar@@ rels last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have risen by more than 25 million bar@@ rels .
But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tic@@ k in activity .
That suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth reb@@ ounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a two @-@ decade low in the previous quarter .
Br@@ ent crude , a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 cents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the ICE exchange in London .
Ab@@ or@@ tion Law in Texas Challeng@@ ed
A federal appeal court in Texas has re@@ introduced certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy , which had been bloc@@ ked by a trial judge this week .
The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force .
The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors who practise abortion will need to have an &quot; ad@@ mitting privilege &quot; with local hospitals .
An ad@@ mitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure , based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital .
Def@@ enders of abortion stress that the content of the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of clinics in the state , as these clinics have failed to obtain the ad@@ mitting privilege for their practitioners .
In all , nearly 2@@ 2,000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments .
On Monday , the day before the law was due to come into force , a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to ad@@ mitting privileges were un@@ constitutional .
But the Attorney General for Texas , Re@@ public@@ an Greg Abbot@@ t , who is can@@ v@@ assing for the role of govern@@ or , asked the court of appeal to over@@ turn the judgement from the trial court bloc@@ king the application of the law .
A plenary hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in January .
&quot; La Nouvelle Star &quot; made a big com@@ e@@ back in terms of audiences , with 1.3 million TV viewers , that is a 5.6 % share of the viewing audience .
But was the show up to expectations ?
Some 10,000 candidates turned up at the audi@@ tions to face the jury for this 10th season : Maur@@ ane , the n@@ augh@@ ty S@@ incl@@ air , the high @-@ pit@@ ched André Man@@ ou@@ k@@ ian and Oli@@ vier Bas .
The viewers shared their thoughts on T@@ wit@@ ter .
The exc@@ itement of finding their favor@@ ite programme having sub@@ sided , many are dis@@ appointed .
But why where they so dis@@ appointed ?
None of the contest@@ ants seem to have really stood out at first gl@@ ance .
As every year , the first audition shows th@@ re@@ w in a wide variety of bud@@ ding sing@@ ers into the mix , sometimes for the best and sometimes not .
But , on T@@ wit@@ ter , people want a spectacle , emo@@ tion , origin@@ ality , music ...
For@@ tun@@ ately , a few got just that .
Many people have tried &quot; La Nouvelle Star &quot; , and some have even gotten through .
Beh@@ ind the television screens , there are always those cut out to be successful sing@@ ers , season after season .

Court blocks ruling on N@@ Y@@ PD stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday bloc@@ ked a judge &apos;s order requiring changes to the New York Police Department &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
The 2nd U.S. Cir@@ cuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Sh@@ ira S@@ che@@ ind@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people .
The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders , including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay .
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromis@@ ing the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrong@@ ly targeting black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men with its stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k program .
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test body @-@ worn cameras in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most stops occur .
In August , New York City agreed to end the practice of st@@ oring the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop .
An oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for some@@ time after March 14 , 2014 .
The stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k tacti@@ c has been critici@@ zed by a number of civil rights advocates .
Stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Blo@@ om@@ berg to an all @-@ time high in 2011 of 68@@ 4,@@ 330 , mostly of black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men .
A law@@ suit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
Sup@@ porters of changes to the N@@ Y@@ PD &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will m@@ old a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
Op@@ ponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after sh@@ r@@ inking by thousands of officers during the last decade .
The judge noted she was@@ n &apos;t putting an end to the stop @-@ and @-@ fr@@ is@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was reforming the way the N@@ Y@@ PD implemented its stops .
Ten@@ ants have to go and vote , as each of them pays an average of $ 100 a month in the cost of their accommodation that goes to the City in taxes .
If the owner pays $ 5000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des this figure between each house .
We are forced to increase the rent to help us pay the new taxes .
By going to vote , we are sending a clear message .
We need to change things in the city .
All the candidates have told us that they would tackle this scand@@ al@@ ous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay $ 100,000 for fire@@ works , $ 4 @-@ 5 million for land just in case ...
Go and vote , that is the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough .
End of the Road for El@@ y@@ sée Head Chef
Having entered the 500@@ m2 @-@ space of the kitch@@ ens at the El@@ y@@ sée Palace as an assistant after working in emb@@ assi@@ es , the co@@ ok clim@@ bed up the lad@@ der to become head chef nine years ago .
He has served six French pre@@ sidents , from Georges P@@ omp@@ id@@ ou to Nicolas Sar@@ ko@@ zy and François Holl@@ ande , including at their holiday homes , and fed an un@@ coun@@ table number of world figures , surrounded by a cloud of anony@@ m@@ ity that he has only emerged from today , as he reti@@ res at 60 .
Bor@@ n on 24 October 1953 in La Fer@@ té @-@ Saint @-@ Au@@ bin , the man with an open face , a bal@@ ding head and the gl@@ asses of an intellectual is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in conf@@ ection@@ ery .
His mother was a co@@ ok in a château in S@@ ologne .
&quot; I &apos;ve moved from one château to another ! &quot; says Bernard V@@ au@@ s@@ sion ir@@ on@@ ically . He is familiar , not only with the habits of the six pre@@ sidents for whom he has co@@ oked , but also with those of their wives and some of their illus@@ tri@@ ous guests .
&quot; It &apos;s always the Head of State or his partner or wife who choo@@ ses the menu , &quot; he recalls .
&quot; Madame Chi@@ ra@@ c was a little more involved and would come right into the kitchen , &quot; to the point where she for@@ b@@ ade women to enter the kitch@@ ens in the El@@ y@@ sée Palace !
With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively in@@ different to fruits of the earth , &quot; they are all fond of food &quot; Bernard V@@ au@@ s@@ sion reveals graci@@ ously .
Jacques Chi@@ ra@@ c certainly had a &quot; more refined pal@@ ate &quot; .
But with Nicolas Sar@@ ko@@ zy , who for@@ b@@ ade cheese , the plates always came back empty !
François Holl@@ ande , who re@@ introduced cheese , is &quot; a man who lik@@ es to eat &quot; and &quot; he is not very cho@@ os@@ y &quot; .
The current Head of State , who has put back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign , does &quot; not have a specific diet requirement &quot; .
Bernard V@@ au@@ s@@ sion also recalls the pressure that would rest on his shoul@@ ders , especially during state din@@ ners at the El@@ y@@ sée , where one had to serve &quot; between 200 and 250 people in around an hour &quot; .
The night before would be practically sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess .
Such people would not understand if something went wrong .
The now former head chef at the El@@ y@@ sée , who shared a drink on Tuesday evening with his team , his family and friends , is leaving with a tw@@ inge of sor@@ row . &quot; François Holl@@ ande came to say good@@ b@@ ye . &quot;
He was full of pr@@ aise .
&quot; His human side came out , &quot; he recalls .
The chef will be replaced by his assistant , 35 @-@ year @-@ old Guill@@ aume Gom@@ ez , who has been at the El@@ y@@ sée for sevent@@ een years himself .
Fire in 18@@ 50 Quebec House
A historic house built in 18@@ 50 in Old Quebec was eng@@ ul@@ fed in fl@@ ames on Friday at lun@@ ch@@ time .
The four @-@ apartment building located at 15 Rue Hé@@ bert set off three al@@ arms at the fire department .
The fire started at the front , but spread to all three floors of the building .
France Vo@@ is@@ elle , spo@@ kes@@ person for the Quebec Fire Protection Service , said that the quick intervention of the fire brigade prevented the fire spreading to adjacent buildings , a major challenge in this part of town where the buildings are very close together .
The building damaged by the fire contained four apartments , but there was no@@ body at home when the fire started .
The damage was fairly limited all in all , although the water caused some harm .
An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause , although the fire brigade has ruled out the possibility of it being a criminal act .

C@@ oul@@ son used phone h@@ acking to verify tip
Former News of the World editor Andy C@@ oul@@ son allegedly used &quot; phone h@@ acking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bo@@ gus tip about an aff@@ air involving then @-@ home secretary Charles Clarke .
Prosecutor Andrew E@@ dis QC told the Old Bai@@ ley that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot; attractive special adviser , &quot; H@@ ann@@ ah P@@ aw@@ l@@ by .
The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mul@@ c@@ aire with h@@ acking P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ails and &quot; door @-@ step@@ ped &quot; her , but C@@ oul@@ son also called and left her vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ails , the court heard .
&quot; The prosecution suggests that Mr C@@ oul@@ son , who is now the editor of the Not@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hop@@ ing to catch them out , he is the man who lik@@ es to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr E@@ dis said .
He said the Not@@ W used three ways to investigate stories : phone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confrontation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
Ob@@ viously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
What about the first ?
Does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
He says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; O@@ h yes , he did &quot; .
R@@ um@@ ours about an aff@@ air involving Clarke were first pic@@ ked up by the Not@@ W &apos;s features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; Don &apos;t b@@ other was@@ ting your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
A tape of vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mul@@ c@@ aire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator &apos;s computer which had Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by and her sister as &quot; Projects . &quot;
During the period she was being investigated , Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr E@@ dis said .
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Nev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and former reporter James We@@ ather@@ up o@@ vers@@ aw surveillance of Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s movements .
Le@@ aving her a vo@@ ic@@ email on June 18 2005 , C@@ oul@@ son told her : &quot; I &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;
Mr E@@ dis said C@@ oul@@ son &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secretary David Bl@@ un@@ k@@ ett .
The jury heard on Thursday that C@@ oul@@ son confronted Mr Bl@@ un@@ k@@ ett over an aff@@ air with a married woman while he was himself seeing co @-@ defendant Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Brooks , who was married at the time .
C@@ oul@@ son and Brooks deny con@@ spir@@ ing with others to h@@ ack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 .
Mul@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ ather@@ up have admitted phone h@@ acking .
Bar@@ ack Obama to Me@@ et Iraqi Prime Minister as Violence R@@ ages
The American President will receive the Iraqi Prime Minister , N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki , who is seeking the United States &apos; help in the struggle against the strongest wave of violence in five years , on 1 November 2013 , .
October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month in Iraq in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday , 01 November .
9@@ 64 people ( of which 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers ) were killed in acts of violence during October and 1,@@ 600 people were injured .
The UN has reported even higher numbers with 9@@ 79 dead and 1,@@ 902 injured .
The violence is becoming more and more dead@@ ly in spite of reinforced security measures and large @-@ scale military operations undertaken in recent months by N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki &apos;s government , which is dominated by Shi@@ ites .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1,0@@ 73 people were killed .
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops , the level of violence brings renewed fears of un@@ rest while the country &apos;s neighb@@ or , Syria , is in the gri@@ p of civil war .
Bom@@ bs strike markets , mos@@ ques , wed@@ dings and fun@@ eral ceremonies .
People are attacked in the street and even at home , and the security forces are also frequent targets of the attacks .
The growing dis@@ content among the Sun@@ ni minority , which held power under Sadd@@ am Hussein and is now compl@@ aining of being politically marginalized and being the target of un@@ just arrests , has fav@@ ored this out@@ bur@@ st of violence .
On Friday , the latest acts of violence left four people dead in the north of Iraq , a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks , which included five boo@@ by @-@ tr@@ apped cars being b@@ low@@ n up in the north of Baghdad .
The majority of the violence is attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( EI@@ IL ) , a group affiliated with Al @-@ Qaida ( Sun@@ ni extremis@@ ts ) , which is also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against Al @-@ Qaida .
The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States with Prime Minister N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received by President Bar@@ ack Obama on Friday , two years after their last meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At that time , the American President , who was elected on the promise of bringing to an end the US &apos; military involvement in the country , painted an optimis@@ tic picture of the situation .
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday , N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki has met several government officials and members of Congress .
On Thursday , he ple@@ aded that the international community should conduct a &quot; third world war &quot; against Al @-@ Qaida .
The principle of security aid for Iraq is supported by influential Re@@ public@@ an and Democratic senators .
However , they have also critici@@ zed Shi@@ ite N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki , saying he is partly responsible for the resumption of violence because of his &quot; sec@@ tari@@ an and author@@ itarian policies &quot; .
They have also demanded that Bar@@ ack Obama make N@@ ouri Al M@@ ali@@ ki understand that &quot; the per@@ n@@ icious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in the relationship between our two countries &quot; .
Beijing Ac@@ cus@@ es U@@ igh@@ ur Group of Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Att@@ ack
The head of internal security in China accused a group of U@@ igh@@ ur separ@@ atis@@ ts from X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on Friday of being behind the car bom@@ b attack in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday , which left five people dead .
The vehicle , an SU@@ V , rac@@ ed towards the crow@@ d in the famous square in the Chinese capital , the symbol of the bloo@@ dy 1989 suppression , before cat@@ ching fire , killing its three occupants and two pas@@ sers @-@ by .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ zh@@ u , a member of the polit@@ bur@@ o in charge of internal security issues , accused the East Turk@@ est@@ an Islamic Movement of in@@ stig@@ ating the attack .
Numerous U@@ igh@@ urs , a Turkish @-@ speaking minority in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , call this Chinese province East Turk@@ est@@ an .
The Chinese government believes the movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence in the province , spar@@ ked by demands for independence .
&quot; The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and pre@@ me@@ dit@@ ated , &quot; said Men@@ g on Hong Kong television channel Pho@@ en@@ ix TV .
&quot; The group hi@@ ding behind the scen@@ es was the East Turk@@ est@@ an Islamic Movement , &quot; he added , his words being rel@@ ayed by the X@@ in@@ hu@@ a News Agency .
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle , whose name suggests he is of U@@ igh@@ ur origin , and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The vehicle also held containers full of petro@@ l and a flag with ortho@@ dox religious writing on it .
The incident left 42 people injured .
The East Turk@@ est@@ an Islamic Movement is considered by the United States and the United Nations to be a terrorist organization .
V@@ ati@@ can Pol@@ l on Contr@@ ac@@ eption , Div@@ or@@ ce and Hom@@ o@@ sexu@@ ality
The V@@ ati@@ can is to carry out a large @-@ scale poll across the world on the way in which par@@ ishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception , divor@@ ces and same @-@ sex couples .
The poll will ask participants how pri@@ ests deal with gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds .
The poll was sent out to every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops in mid @-@ October , with instructions to secure as many responses as possible .
The information will be used at a major assembly on the family that P@@ ope Francis is planning to organize next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Re@@ porter , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spo@@ kes@@ person for the United States Conference of Catholic B@@ ish@@ ops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bis@@ hop would decide on the appropriate way in which to approach par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers .
In the United Kingdom , b@@ ish@@ ops have published the poll on the Internet and asked Cath@@ ol@@ ics to participate .
D@@ RC : Army Att@@ acks Last Re@@ bel S@@ tron@@ gh@@ old
The di@@ eh@@ ards of the M@@ 23 , who are several hundreds in number , had entr@@ en@@ ched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the farm@@ land h@@ ills of Chan@@ zu , R@@ un@@ y@@ ony@@ i and M@@ bu@@ zi , close to Bun@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ omb@@ a , two towns located around 80@@ km north of G@@ oma , the capital of North Kivu province .
&quot; The fighting has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the dar@@ k@@ ness , &quot; a resident of J@@ omb@@ a , according to whom a little girl had been injured by gun@@ fire in the morning , told the AF@@ P by telephone at around 12.@@ 30@@ pm .
&quot; The fighting has slightly reduced in intensity . It appears that the Armed Forces of the D@@ RC ( FAR@@ DC ) have pushed the reb@@ els back a bit , &quot; he added .
According to this witness , who chose to remain anonymous , the soldiers had &quot; spent the night &quot; in J@@ omb@@ a , before going into action for a &quot; comb@@ ing operation &quot; .
The r@@ attle of gun@@ fire from light arms could clearly be heard in the background .
From Bun@@ ag@@ ana , a political str@@ on@@ gh@@ old and last preserve of the re@@ bel@@ lion to fall on Wednesday , an AF@@ P journalist could hear the det@@ onation of heavy arms .
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the D@@ RC ( MONU@@ SCO ) , the fighting has entered &quot; the final phase &quot; : the FAR@@ DC has &quot; surrounded the remaining M@@ 23 positions to fl@@ ush them out &quot; .
Since the resumption on Friday of confron@@ tations between the March 23 Movement ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , MONU@@ SCO has not been participating directly in the fighting , but it is providing government &apos;s troops with critical support in terms of intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several do@@ zen well @-@ equipped soldiers headed off towards the front .
They were armed with Kal@@ ash@@ ni@@ kov@@ s and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road to Bun@@ ag@@ ana , the frontier post with Uganda , soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple roc@@ ket laun@@ cher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the FAR@@ DC , intended to take over from another device po@@ un@@ ding the positions of the M@@ 23 in the h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Joseph Kab@@ ila , called on the reb@@ els once again on Wednesday to &quot; stand down voluntarily &quot; or be dis@@ armed &quot; by force &quot; , while leaving open the K@@ amp@@ ala process , where Kinshasa and the M@@ 23 have been in discussions since December with no outcome as yet .
The political leaders of the M@@ 23 are hop@@ ing to reach an agreement there .
&quot; We have finished the talks . The U@@ gan@@ dan medi@@ ators just need to organize the signing , &quot; asserted Roger Lum@@ bal@@ a , vice @-@ president of the M@@ 23 delegation , although this information could not be confirmed immediately with the government .
The M@@ 23 was born of an April 2012 mu@@ tiny by former reb@@ els , principally T@@ ut@@ sis who were integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement .
The UN and Kinshasa regularly acc@@ use Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M@@ 23 . K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala have denied the accusations .
North Kivu is one of the most dens@@ ely populated areas of the D@@ RC , and its land ab@@ ounds in co@@ v@@ eted mineral resources .
At Bun@@ ag@@ ana , on the U@@ gan@@ dan side of the border , to which around 5,000 people fl@@ ed between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the process of returning which started in the morning was reversed at mid@@ day .
&quot; This morning we went back across the border to go back to our fields , but the soldiers told us to go back , &quot; the AF@@ P was told by Im@@ el@@ da Ny@@ ir@@ ank@@ us@@ i , surrounded by her nine children , including an infant on her back .
The gun@@ fire seems to be getting closer to the population .
Early that evening , do@@ z@@ ens of residents were crossing the border , some with mat@@ t@@ resses on their heads , to spend the night in Uganda .
Mus@@ icals , the Great Perform@@ ances
Class@@ ical , sophisticated , popular , in English or in French , song and dance productions are starting to take off .
After Broad@@ way and London , Paris is finally finding its voice .
It &apos;s a revolution : the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre .
For a long time , the majority of attempts , from &apos; Notre @-@ Dame de Paris &apos; to &apos; Moz@@ art , l &apos;@@ Op@@ éra Rock &apos; , have been emb@@ ro@@ iled in ri@@ dic@@ ule .
And successful acts such as &apos; Cab@@ aret &apos; or &apos; Les Mis@@ ér@@ ables &apos; have had an air of myster@@ y about them .
The arrival of Jean @-@ Luc Ch@@ op@@ lin at the Ch@@ â@@ tel@@ et and Stage Entertainment at the Mo@@ g@@ ador has changed all that .
Today , these two stages are chur@@ ning out performances like h@@ its .
The former is re@@ pris@@ ing its excellent &apos; My Fair L@@ ady &apos; this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of &apos; Un Améric@@ ain à Paris &apos; as a follow @-@ up .
At the Mo@@ g@@ ador , &apos; La B@@ elle et la B@@ ête &apos; could well be one of the successes of the season .
On other stages , mus@@ icals such as &apos; 17@@ 89 : les A@@ mants de la Bas@@ til@@ le &apos; and small productions such as &apos; Dis@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far .
Patrick Ni@@ edo , author of the reference book &apos; Hist@@ oires de com@@ é@@ dies musicales &apos; and speaker at the Théâtre du Ch@@ â@@ tel@@ et , analyses the reasons for the hard @-@ won success .
How are French mus@@ icals evolving ?
The choice is growing .
Firstly there are the &quot; musical shows &quot; that evolve according to the will of the producers ...
Some use lo@@ vely projections of images and a true story , such as &apos; 17@@ 89 : les A@@ mants de la Bas@@ til@@ le &apos; .
Others le@@ ap back@@ wards fifteen years , under the pre@@ text that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you have Mat@@ t Po@@ k@@ ora heading the bill .
Then there are the mus@@ icals with the su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous productions of the Ch@@ â@@ tel@@ et , which allow us to bring the gol@@ den age of Broad@@ way back to life and re@@ discover the univer@@ se of Stephen Sond@@ heim , the greatest composer alive .
Stage Entertainment popul@@ ari@@ zes variety English mus@@ icals by adapting them into French .
Independent French producers are trying to make a break@@ through .
But projects under way such as &apos; R@@ ent &apos; , &apos; Le B@@ aiser de la Fem@@ me Ar@@ aign@@ ée &apos; or &apos; L &apos;@@ É@@ ve@@ il du Print@@ emps &apos; are having trouble finding finances .
Do we have enough artists capable of sing@@ ing , acting and d@@ ancing , as on Broad@@ way ?
In Paris , when there are eight mus@@ icals in a season , then it &apos;s a good year .
We have 200 tal@@ ented artists who move from project to project .
In the United States , the cr@@ ad@@ le of the musical , it is very different .
Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools .
There are numerous jobs in regional the@@ atres , tour@@ ing companies , Broad@@ way , off Broad@@ way etc .
The breeding ground for talent is as si@@ z@@ able as the number of roles available .
Why are provincial tours so successful ?
With the exception of oper@@ a , the provinces remain the poor relative of culture in France .
F@@ ew the@@ a@@ trical productions go on tour and most of them are usually &quot; boulevard theatre &quot; , intended for adults , not adolescents .
Mus@@ icals fill that gap .
These are the same young people that love reality television and the eph@@ em@@ eral stars it produces ...
Off@@ ering good @-@ looking ( often tal@@ ented ) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the ad@@ oration of young girls and often their entire family .
F@@ ace@@ book pages for these shows are sk@@ ill@@ fully managed by professionals who answer questions .
The shows are e@@ ag@@ erly expected by the time they reach a provincial Z@@ én@@ ith ( theatre ) .
The mus@@ icals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces .
The show is designed to be st@@ aged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris .
One Ser@@ i@@ ously In@@ jured in Ac@@ cident with W@@ r@@ ong Way D@@ river on Brussels R@@ ing Road
A road accident on the Brussels inner ring road near Ho@@ e@@ il@@ a@@ art in the direction of Waterloo at 5.@@ 30@@ am on Friday morning left one person seriously injured .
The car driven by the injured woman was hit by a driver who was travelling in the wrong direction and came out un@@ hur@@ t .
The section of the ring road where the accident occurred was closed to traffic until 9@@ am for the road to be cleared and for an expert to establish the circumstances of the accident .
This situation , however , did not create traffic j@@ am as the accident happened at the exit of Ho@@ e@@ il@@ a@@ art .
Traffic was therefore diver@@ ted via the exit / entrance to the ring road .
Child Ser@@ i@@ ously In@@ jured on R@@ ide at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris
A child aged five has been seriously injured following an accident on a ride at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris .
His life is not in danger but he is still in hospital .
The boy was with his father on the &quot; P@@ ir@@ ates of the Carib@@ beans &quot; boat ride when he fell .
The ride has been closed till further notice .
D@@ RC : Army Prepar@@ es New Ass@@ ault
Children play on a char@@ red tank that belong@@ ed to M@@ 23 reb@@ els , at K@@ ib@@ umb@@ a in the east of the D@@ RC on 31 October 2013 .
On Friday the Congolese army was preparing a new assault on the final bas@@ tions of the M@@ 23 reb@@ els close to Bun@@ ag@@ ana in the east of the D@@ RC .
The aim of the assault is to fl@@ ush the M@@ 23 out of the h@@ ills over@@ looking Bun@@ ag@@ ana .
Y@@ esterday , we took Bu@@ g@@ ina hill , which over@@ looks M@@ bu@@ zi hill .
Today , M@@ bu@@ zi is expected to fall as well .
Then only R@@ um@@ y@@ oni hill will be left .
&quot; Chan@@ zu hill is not strategic , &quot; the govern@@ or of North Kivu , Juli@@ en Pal@@ uk@@ u , told the AF@@ P .
Mr Pal@@ uk@@ u hopes to be in Bun@@ ag@@ ana on Saturday .
The town , which is a political str@@ on@@ gh@@ old and the final bas@@ tion of the re@@ bel@@ lion , lies on the border with Uganda , around 80@@ km north of G@@ oma .
It was rec@@ ap@@ tured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( FAR@@ DC ) on Wednesday .
Since then , several hundred M@@ 23 di@@ eh@@ ards have been cut off in the farm@@ land h@@ ills of Chan@@ zu , R@@ un@@ y@@ ony@@ i and M@@ bu@@ zi , close to Bun@@ ag@@ ana and the neighbouring town of J@@ omb@@ a , at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres .
In J@@ omb@@ a , a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been &quot; calm since this morning &quot; .
He also said that a woman and child had been killed in fighting the previous evening and had been bur@@ ied .
A little girl sustained injuries from gun@@ fire , and three other people had been wounded . One of them was seriously hit and had been ev@@ acu@@ ated by the FAR@@ DC , the witness quoted by the AF@@ P added .
Since the resumption of hostilities between the FAR@@ DC and the reb@@ els on 25 October , the two sides have given no indication of the casualties .
N@@ SA re@@ vel@@ ations boost corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , Germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the ro@@ of@@ top of the US out@@ post , which is located less than 5@@ km from the European Central Bank and Bundes@@ bank .
German media say the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening anten@@ n@@ as and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin .
James Cl@@ app@@ er , US Director of National Intelligence , ins@@ isted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to ste@@ al the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
But ever since Edward Snow@@ den , the contractor turned wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , began releasing his t@@ reas@@ ure tro@@ ve of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
Reports that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Brazilian oil company Petro@@ bras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Ya@@ ho@@ o have r@@ atch@@ eted corporate par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s .
The final str@@ aw came when it was revealed that Chancell@@ or Angela Mer@@ kel &apos;s phone had been bu@@ gg@@ ed , possibly for about a decade .
If Europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then su@@ rely business leaders are also potential targets .
Snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it &apos;s conce@@ iv@@ able that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; says Oliver Gr@@ ü@@ n , president of B@@ IT@@ Mi , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data theft , according to a survey published in July by EY , the consult@@ ancy .
In all the documentation le@@ aked by Mr Snow@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secrets to its own companies .
Poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US .
Business leaders are scep@@ tical about this .
Some@@ one in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; That &apos;s not the way , &quot; Hass@@ o Pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of German business software company SAP , says .
If one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one shoul@@ dn &apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago .
Every@@ thing is subsi@@ dis@@ ed in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
Every@@ thing but the IT industry .
Still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ y agencies exposed by the Snow@@ den re@@ vel@@ ations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China .
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the Cl@@ ou@@ d Security Alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non @-@ US members cancelled plans to use a US @-@ based cloud provider after re@@ vel@@ ations about the US Pris@@ m data mining programme .
Jim S@@ nab@@ e , co @-@ chief executive at SAP , says : &quot; We see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction . &quot;
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secrets and these data must therefore be guar@@ ded at all costs .
That economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
It has always taken place .
&quot; This has been a topic for many years and has@@ n &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kur@@ t B@@ ock , chief executive of chemical maker BAS@@ F .
The Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an att@@ ack@@ er .
For large companies , the message has long since been dr@@ um@@ med home that p@@ icking up a free USB stick at a trade fair , or leaving a lap@@ top un@@ guar@@ ded in a hotel room are un@@ wise , to say the least .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ack@@ enberg , board member at car@@ maker Au@@ di , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany &apos;s B@@ f@@ V advises executives to consider using simple pre@@ paid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised .
The pre@@ paid mobiles are then thro@@ wn away after@@ wards .
However , there is concern that small and medium @-@ sized companies remain vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
In Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche .
&quot; Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against un@@ authorised access , &quot; the B@@ f@@ V war@@ ns in a report .
The US war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pion@@ age by other countries .
The US National Intelligence Estim@@ ate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in h@@ acking for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
A board member at a German blue @-@ chi@@ p company conc@@ urred that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Bernard S@@ quar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ CR@@ I , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co @-@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
Parents of Georgia teen who died in &apos; fre@@ ak accident &apos; believe son was mur@@ dered
The parents of a Georgia teen@@ ager , whose body was found inside a rolled @-@ up w@@ rest@@ ling mat in his high school gy@@ m , believe their son was mur@@ dered , the family &apos;s attorney said Thursday .
K@@ endr@@ ick Johnson , of Val@@ do@@ sta , G@@ a . , was found Jan@@ . 11 st@@ uck in an u@@ pri@@ ght mat prop@@ ped behind the ble@@ ach@@ ers inside his high school gy@@ m .
L@@ own@@ des County sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investigators concluded Johnson died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; They absolutely think their son was mur@@ dered , &quot; Benjamin Cr@@ ump , an attorney representing Kenneth and J@@ acqu@@ el@@ yn Johnson , told Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s.com .
They never believed he died the way the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
&quot; They believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physics as well as common sense , &quot; Cr@@ ump said .
They think this is a cover @-@ up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; They sent their son to school with a book @-@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson &apos;s death , noting that several key questions remain un@@ answered .
What was the cause of death ?
Was his death the result of a crime ?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
My objective is to discovery the truth .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists &quot; for a formal investigation , he said .
Moore told re@@ porters that the initial aut@@ op@@ sy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . &quot;
A second aut@@ op@@ sy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Moore .
&quot; There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Moore added that if he un@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the F@@ BI to conduct it .
A representative from the L@@ own@@ des County Sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday .
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed .
The teen@@ ager &apos;s parents said they hope the video foot@@ age will contain clu@@ es to how he died .
CDC issues children &apos;s all@@ ergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as the number of school @-@ age children suffering from food aller@@ gies clim@@ bs .
One in 20 children in the United States now have food aller@@ gies .
The CDC found the prevalence of food aller@@ gies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children &apos;s food aller@@ gies , and how to handle them should an aller@@ gic reaction occur .
It also recommends schools have ep@@ in@@ eph@@ rine stoc@@ ked -- the Epi@@ P@@ en brand auto @-@ injec@@ tor being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal an@@ aphy@@ lax@@ is .
State legisl@@ atures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ in@@ eph@@ rine more easily .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an aller@@ gic reaction .
Kids may say , &quot; It feels like something is po@@ king my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels like there is hair on it , &quot; or &quot; My tongue is tin@@ gl@@ ing . &quot;
N@@ SA Aff@@ air Emphasizes Complete Lack of Deb@@ ate on Intelligence
Why the contradic@@ tory attitude of the French government ? On the one hand , it publicly takes offence and sum@@ mons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and , on the other , it for@@ bids the Boli@@ vian president &apos;s plane to enter its air space on the basis of a rum@@ or that Edward Snow@@ den was on board ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French government .
When François Holl@@ ande tel@@ eph@@ ones Bar@@ ack Obama , or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fab@@ i@@ us sum@@ mons the Ambassador of the United States , they are responding to a real discovery , that of the scale of America &apos;s surveillance of communications within France generally .
And is it not surprising to read in the pages of Le Monde , on the one hand , a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and , on the other , condemn@@ ation of the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Qu@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ say , within a matter of weeks ?
Is there not an element of hypo@@ cris@@ y on your part ?
The journ@@ alistic method is not to adopt a moral position , but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and enable every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks reveals the American administration &apos;s monitoring of political and other matters some@@ where in the world , we consider this to be significant en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment with regard to the American government .
In describing the American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States , we do not aim at expressing indi@@ gn@@ ation about this practice , but rather at describing the world as it is .
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the N@@ SA concerning terrorist operations against our interests ?
Can we do without collaboration with the Americans ?
The setting up of high @-@ performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Furthermore , in this regard , France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures , sometimes described as essential , for cooperating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis .
For example , France was informed of the presence of Mohammed Mer@@ ah in the tribal areas of Mir@@ an@@ sh@@ ah through the N@@ SA &apos;s resources .
Also France may , for example , have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sah@@ el region to the Americans and , in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world .
Hence the question at the heart of the N@@ SA aff@@ air is not so much the capacity or the right of a country to use interception tools , as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliaments - on the justification of such systems , the extent to which they should be used and , ultimately , the issue of the infringement of freedoms .
What risk does the United States actually run ? Ru@@ ining its image ?
However much we den@@ ounce the US , I see no way in which it can be punished .
The risk run by the Americans could be tw@@ o@@ fold .
The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been spi@@ ed on , sometimes at the highest level .
This is the case in Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are str@@ ained .
Another effect could be more commercial : in the light of the re@@ vel@@ ations , more and more European and South American countries are bal@@ king at the idea of entr@@ us@@ ting their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and hence to the gri@@ ps of the N@@ SA .
Finally , the widespread exercise in re@@ vel@@ ations conducted by the media across the world , which is contributing to the establishment of a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost in@@ visible until now , could force legisl@@ ators - including those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies .
Parents of Inter@@ sex Kids Can P@@ ick &apos; Gender Un@@ determin@@ e@@ d&apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous gen@@ it@@ alia .
No longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
The new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates .
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make has@@ ty decisions on sex @-@ assignment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
One inter@@ sex person , according to the B@@ BC , said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
They are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrella term for those with at@@ yp@@ ical chromosomes , gon@@ ads ( o@@ varies or tes@@ tes ) , or un@@ usually developed gen@@ it@@ alia .
W@@ alli@@ s Simpson may have been inter@@ sex .
Gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
New York City psychi@@ atr@@ ist Dr. Jack D@@ res@@ cher , who speci@@ alizes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
Inter@@ sex children pose ethical dilem@@ ma .
&quot; Some people have life @-@ endang@@ ering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
You can make a gender assignment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
Nob@@ ody can answer the questions about why this happens .
It &apos;s like the myster@@ y of why people are gay .
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological mak@@ eu@@ p , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , hair distribution , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure ; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ it@@ alia ; or in chromo@@ som@@ al structures and hormones .
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the real@@ m of employment , as well as levels of harassment , violence and bias crimes .
Gender non@@ conform@@ ing boys now have special camp .
Al@@ ready , Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
In June , a 52 @-@ year @-@ old Australian , Nor@@ rie May @-@ Wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; gend@@ er@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X , for inter@@ sex , according to the Interior Ministry .
In neighb@@ oring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
In 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks .
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; as the world is being dr@@ agged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pillars of civili@@ zation . &quot;
One Mary@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the Bab@@ y Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; Par@@ enting is stress@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the parenting website .
Children need stability and certainty .
Hist@@ orically , children born with both male and female gen@@ it@@ alia were called her@@ m@@ aph@@ ro@@ dites , named for the hand@@ some Greek go@@ d who had dual sexu@@ ality .
And as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a sl@@ ate that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn .
But now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up .
&quot; Back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psychiatric emergency , &apos; &quot; said D@@ res@@ cher .
When these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psychi@@ atr@@ ist , you called a sur@@ geon .
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous gen@@ it@@ alia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Joh@@ ns Hop@@ kins University , who held that gender was mal@@ le@@ able .
He coin@@ ed the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
But in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Joan , &quot; his the@@ ories became controversial .
He advised the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to have the child fully cas@@ tr@@ ated , removing his tes@@ ticles , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; Money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said D@@ res@@ cher .
When the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
But at 38 , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ cher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model . &quot;
But in the 1990s , with the ad@@ vent of the Internet , survivors of these gender surg@@ eries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
Such was the case with Jim Bruce , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old writer from Mon@@ tana , who was born with X@@ Y male chromosomes but ambiguous gen@@ it@@ als .
Doc@@ tors cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t be sure if he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
So shortly after his birth in 1976 , Bruce &apos;s external organ and tes@@ tes were surg@@ ically removed and he was raised as a girl .
He was given female hormones at age 12 .
&quot; I knew that I was@@ n &apos;t a girl , &quot; he told AB@@ CN@@ ew@@ s.com .
I was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he was set for a v@@ agin@@ o@@ plas@@ ty .
But de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
What he found out was horri@@ fying .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me .
Bruce was born with a D@@ SD that prevented his body from producing enough tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als .
After learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one sh@@ ots and having his bre@@ asts removed .
S@@ urg@@ ery rendered him infer@@ tile .
Today , he advocates for others in an organization called the Inter@@ face Project , trying to normal@@ ize perceptions of those who are inter@@ sex .
But Anne Tam@@ ar @-@ M@@ atti@@ s , executive director for California @-@ based legal group Advoc@@ ates for In@@ formed Choice , wor@@ ries that the German law &quot; invites lab@@ eling and stig@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined , &apos; &quot; she said .
We are a@@ fr@@ aid it will encourage intervention .
We think a better process is assign@@ ing male or female sex , then waiting .
But we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is spec@@ ul@@ ate .
Tam@@ ar @-@ M@@ atti@@ s said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; Adul@@ ts should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
German law is about assign@@ ing it at birth .
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
When they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr. Ar@@ lene Bar@@ at@@ z , a Pit@@ ts@@ burgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will &quot; empower &quot; both parents and children .
Bar@@ at@@ z &apos;s daughter K@@ atie was born with male chromosomes , but has a D@@ SD called complete an@@ dro@@ gen in@@ sensitivity syndrome .
Because her an@@ dro@@ gen recep@@ tors are fau@@ l@@ ty , K@@ atie developed female characteristics .
She has a vag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us or o@@ varies .
Now at 29 , K@@ atie is married and at the University of Pennsylv@@ ania , a resident in child psychi@@ a@@ try .
Though she is infer@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or g@@ est@@ ational sur@@ rog@@ acy .
&quot; The law gives parents some space not to have to r@@ ush into making decisions themselves , &quot; said Bar@@ at@@ z .
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos; 
This way , you are OK -- raise the child , love the child .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
We don &apos;t have to r@@ ush into surgery that is ir@@ reversible .
&quot; It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
Ul@@ timately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
It em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
Let@@ ta Confi@@ dent of Government &apos;s Sur@@ vival
The President of the Italian Council , En@@ r@@ ico Let@@ ta , believes his government will last until 2015 , despite strong tension between the left and right wings within the ruling coalition in the run @-@ up to the Senate &apos;s vote on stri@@ pping Sil@@ vi@@ o Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i of his mandate .
In an interview with daily newspaper La St@@ amp@@ a , the leader of the centre left said he had &quot; every intention &quot; of continuing to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015 .
The Upper House of the Italian parliament will meet this month to decide on the fate of the former president , who was found guilty of tax ev@@ asion in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i is threatening to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate , in which he has more op@@ ponents than supporters , decides to reli@@ eve him of his duties .
But one section of his camp , cent@@ ered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom ( PD@@ L ) party , Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , is continuing to support the government , as it demonstrated on October 2 when it refused to follow Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i &apos;s orders on a previous attempt to bring down the cabinet .
The L.@@ A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Security Administration ( T@@ SA ) and a suspect have been wounded during an exchange of gun@@ fire .
Fi@@ rem@@ en called to the scene of the drama confirmed that they had responded to a call reporting &quot; multiple injuries &quot; .
&quot; Law enforcement agents are at the scene , &quot; the airport stated on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , while television pictures were showing people being ev@@ acu@@ ated in ambul@@ ances .
&quot; There was a shoot @-@ out , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man for the United States Transportation Security Administration ( T@@ SA ) told the AF@@ P .
Local channel ABC showed one person being ev@@ acu@@ ated on a stret@@ cher and a second in a wheelchair .
The airport also stated that the incident took place at around 9.@@ 30@@ am local time ( 12.@@ 30@@ pm Montreal time ) in Terminal 3 of the airport .
The Los Angeles Times stated that terminals 2 and 3 are being ev@@ acu@@ ated .

Israeli Army K@@ ills Hamas Member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Palestinian Islamic milit@@ ant and left another seriously wounded south of the Gaza Strip on Thursday , according to healthcare sources .
A Hamas source explained that fighting bro@@ ke out in the region after Israeli tanks cross@@ ed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mort@@ ar fire .
The Israeli army simply mentioned carrying out &quot; targeted action &quot; in the area close to what the Jewish state calls a &quot; terrorist &quot; tunnel du@@ g at the border , the discovery of which was reported in mid @-@ October .
Report : Obama campaign considered dumping B@@ id@@ en for H@@ illary Clinton
President Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s closest advisers secret@@ ly considered replacing Vice President Joe B@@ id@@ en with H@@ illary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
The re@@ vel@@ ation is the most notable bomb@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ em@@ ann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign t@@ ome , &quot; Double D@@ own : Game Change 2012 . &quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President &apos;s top aides conducted &quot; extensive group @-@ sessions and polling in late 2011 &quot; to gauge whether the dumping B@@ id@@ en could help bol@@ ster Obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re @-@ election hopes .
According to the Times &apos; national political correspondent Jonathan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ apping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls .
The potential switch was a closely guar@@ ded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Office .
Only half a do@@ zen of the President &apos;s closest advisers -- including Dal@@ ey , former Obama campaign chief Jim Mess@@ ina , and former White House senior advisers David Ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David Pl@@ ou@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; Double D@@ own &quot; claims Dal@@ ey spe@@ ar@@ headed the effort to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their &quot; close personal rapport , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t &quot; materi@@ ally improve Obama &apos;s od@@ ds . &quot;
In an interview with Martin , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing B@@ id@@ en with Clinton .
&quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole bun@@ ch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Dal@@ ey told the paper .
You have to remember , at that point the President was in aw@@ ful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;
While Dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; Martin told CN@@ N &apos;s Anderson Cooper that the re @-@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .
&quot; Campai@@ gn@@ s don &apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC@@ 360 .
It &apos;s unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was exploring the sw@@ ap .
Martin told CN@@ N that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his then @-@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le .
While Dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; Double D@@ own &quot; does not defin@@ iti@@ vely answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obama &apos;s desk .
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping B@@ id@@ en from the ticket .
&quot; Pos@@ sibly , &quot; Martin replied .
F@@ ancy a g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream ?
A British entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ice cream - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
Char@@ lie Francis has har@@ n@@ essed the fluo@@ rescent properties of the marine animal to develop the lumin@@ escent sn@@ ack .
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically recre@@ ate the g@@ lowing protein .
The ice cream re@@ acts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it g@@ low .
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick , the b@@ righ@@ ter it becomes .
Char@@ lie , founder of the &quot; L@@ ick Me I &apos;m Del@@ icious &quot; ice cream company , said : &quot; It is incredi@@ ble stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
The protein we are using in the ice cream re@@ acts with your tongue at neutral pH .
So as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will g@@ low .
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Hal@@ lo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish lumin@@ escence is four times more expensive than gold .
So each sco@@ op costs me around £ 140 .
It t@@ astes pretty good though .
Char@@ lie &apos;s experimental company , based in Br@@ ist@@ ol , is fam@@ ed for its unusual flav@@ ours including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
He said : &quot; I really want to develop an in@@ visible ice cream . &quot;
It is inher@@ ently impossible because of the re@@ fraction caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cream , but I rec@@ kon we will find a way of doing it .
The ice cream har@@ nesses the fluo@@ rescent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , synthes@@ ized by Chinese scientists
L@@ ou Re@@ ed Di@@ es During T@@ ai Ch@@ i Session
Sing@@ er L@@ ou Re@@ ed died while doing ta@@ i chi exercises , his wife , Laur@@ ie Anderson , announced in a letter published by the regional newspaper , East H@@ ampton Star , which is meant for residents of Spr@@ ings , the town where the couple had a home .
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71 .
&quot; He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st form of ta@@ i chi , with his mus@@ ician hands striking the air , &quot; wrote Laur@@ ie Anderson .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed was a master of the Chinese mar@@ tial art known as ta@@ i chi .
The sing@@ er &apos;s wife also said that , a week before his death , she had promised her husband she would get him out of hospital and take him back to their home in Spr@@ ings ( Long Island ) .
&quot; L@@ ou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
Even though we are city dw@@ ellers , this is our spiritual home .
L@@ ou was a pr@@ ince and a figh@@ ter , and I know his songs on pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredi@@ ble joy of life which he felt , &quot; she added .

Hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : By the Numbers
When I was little , Hal@@ lo@@ ween was mag@@ ical .
My sister and I were allowed to eat cand@@ y , stay up late and play d@@ ress @-@ up for the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , I &apos;ve become more of a sc@@ ro@@ o@@ ge .
I haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out cand@@ y in my apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
But stat@@ s show that I &apos;m a black sheep when it comes to Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebr@@ ating Hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on cand@@ y , cost@@ umes and decor@@ ations , according to the National Retail Federation .
One thing I do look forward to every Hal@@ lo@@ ween are the trends .
Co@@ st@@ umes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NR@@ F .
This year , sex@@ y in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the rage .
Women don &apos;t have to be sex@@ y professionals any@@ more ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like p@@ iz@@ za , ham@@ burg@@ ers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ om@@ bies , thanks to The Wal@@ king De@@ ad and I &apos;ll b@@ et the D@@ aft Pun@@ k space men will make it into our Inst@@ agram fe@@ eds this year .
According to Google , the highest search@@ ed cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ bies , Bat@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I gu@@ ess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
We dress@@ ed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 330 million on pet cost@@ umes this year , according to the NR@@ F .
That &apos;s a lot of ir@@ onic hot@@ dog dogs .
When it comes to cand@@ y , we don &apos;t scre@@ w around .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on it this year , according to The Ni@@ el@@ sen Company .
That &apos;s around 600 million pounds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bars , l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop@@ s , Milk Du@@ ds , Tw@@ iz@@ z@@ lers and Clark B@@ ars .
That &apos;s great news for the 41 million trick @-@ or @-@ treat@@ ers set to take over our neigh@@ bor@@ hoods , according to the U.S. Commerce Department .
In fact , we will buy and , who are we kid@@ ding , consume 90 million pounds of chocol@@ ate during Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The one thing we don &apos;t want to consume , cand@@ y corn ; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the National Conf@@ ection@@ ers Association .
That &apos;s about 9 billion individual kern@@ els of corn .
It &apos;s a myster@@ y I have yet to solve .
Nothing is more qu@@ int@@ essentially Hal@@ lo@@ ween than ha@@ un@@ ted houses .
They have the best names , like &quot; Terro@@ r Beh@@ ind the W@@ alls &quot; ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; How@@ l @-@ O @-@ Scre@@ am &quot; and &quot; The House of Sh@@ ock . &quot;
In fact , there are 1,200 officially sanc@@ tioned ha@@ un@@ ted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes those aw@@ es@@ ome photos of you mid @-@ pe@@ eing your p@@ ants that your friend puts on F@@ ace@@ book and you can &apos;t take down and then that gu@@ y you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;
Finally , let &apos;s talk pu@@ mp@@ kins .
Char@@ lie Brown introduced us to The Great P@@ um@@ p@@ kin when we were kids , and car@@ ving a j@@ ack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern is like decor@@ ating a Christmas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;ve done since we were little .
Luc@@ ky for us , the &quot; baby in a pu@@ mp@@ kin trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ interest , so most of us grew up car@@ ving these gour@@ ds not sitting in them .
This year , Americans will spend around $ 106 million on pu@@ mp@@ kins , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
The j@@ ack @-@ o @-@ lan@@ tern slowly with@@ ering on your front por@@ ch probably came from Illinois , which grew 5@@ 42 million pounds of pu@@ mp@@ kin this year .

The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £ 38 billion ( € 45@@ ,000 million ) of its highest risk assets , a step designed to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its re @-@ privatisation .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of toxic assets on its books from 55 % to 70 % over the next two years and hopes to clean them up completely in three years .
RB@@ S has also said that it will be writing down a provision of £ 4 500 million for the depreciation of additional bad debts for the quarter , an entry related to the setting up of the hi@@ ve @-@ off structure .
RB@@ S has also specified that this internal restructuring would release £ 10 @-@ 11 000 million in capital , thus strengthening its lending ability .
The bank and the City have stressed that the &quot; bad bank &quot; would enable a break @-@ off from the past , government in particular having been accused of interfer@@ ing in the management of RB@@ S .
&quot; We can now move for@@ wards and focus on the future and on the 90 % of assets that make up a really good bank , and on building a great bank for our clients and the United Kingdom , &quot; new director general , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan , said to the press .

Fire crews called to rescue lost pu@@ pp@@ y after she got st@@ uck 50@@ ft above the ground on prec@@ arious le@@ dge in a qu@@ arry
Coc@@ ker sp@@ ani@@ el Ru@@ by had run off after she was in a minor road crash
She was spo@@ t@@ ted three days later by a dog wal@@ ker tr@@ apped in the qu@@ arry
Fire@@ fighters ab@@ seil down cli@@ ff face to pl@@ uck the dog from certain death
A pu@@ pp@@ y had a luc@@ ky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she some@@ how got herself st@@ uck 50@@ ft up on a prec@@ arious cli@@ ff le@@ dge .
N@@ ine month @-@ old coc@@ ker sp@@ ani@@ el Ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before being res@@ cu@@ ed from a qu@@ arry on Wednesday .
Her owners Scott Al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend Bec@@ ky Hall , 20 , were at Fl@@ app@@ it Qu@@ arry in Den@@ hol@@ me , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , to be re@@ united with Ru@@ by and have thanked West Yor@@ k@@ shire Fire and Rescue Service .
They had search@@ ed fr@@ an@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the qu@@ arry following the minor accident .
At around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on Wednesday , an e@@ agle @-@ ey@@ ed dog wal@@ ker spo@@ t@@ ted Ru@@ by on the le@@ dge in the qu@@ arry , str@@ anded 50@@ ft up .
A Technical Rescue Team from Cl@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ aton Fire Station r@@ ush@@ ed to the scene and ab@@ se@@ iled down to rescue Ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the cli@@ ff .
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Cl@@ ay@@ ton said : &apos; She was in a prec@@ arious situation .
She was right in the middle of the cli@@ ff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid .
But she is fine now .
She was eating bis@@ cuits after@@ wards .
This was a very unusual call @-@ out .
The fact that the dog was spo@@ t@@ ted is un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able .
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter L@@ au said : &quot; Ru@@ by had a very luc@@ ky escape . &quot;
The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was taken to the vets for a check @-@ up and was found to be fine other than exhau@@ s@@ tion and de@@ hydr@@ ation .
M@@ iss Hall , from Halifax , West Yor@@ k@@ shire , said : &quot; W@@ atching the rescue was terri@@ fying . &quot;
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
It was amazing to get her back in our arms .
The v@@ et said that if she became too exhausted and coll@@ apsed she would probably have fallen .
The fire@@ fighters were amazing .
It was really d@@ aring what they did .
We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ eigh@@ ley , added : &quot; We were sc@@ ared that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
The fire@@ fighters were bri@@ l@@ liant .
I just can &apos;t believe where she was .
M@@ ick J@@ ag@@ ger says he never hit on Kat@@ y Per@@ ry when she was 18 .
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week , the pop star said she sang bac@@ king voc@@ als for J@@ ag@@ ger &apos;s 2004 song &quot; Old Hab@@ its Die Hard . &quot;
Per@@ ry said she had dinner with the veter@@ an roc@@ ker and that &quot; he hit on me when I was 18 . &quot;
She added , &quot; That was a long time ago , and he &apos;s been very kind . &quot;
In a statement Thursday , a representative for J@@ ag@@ ger , 70 , says he &quot; categ@@ orically den@@ ies that he has ever made a pass at Kat@@ y Per@@ ry . &quot;
The re@@ p adds : &quot; Perhaps she is conf@@ using him with someone else . &quot;

Beijing Bl@@ ames Turk@@ oman Islamic Movement
&quot; Beh@@ ind @-@ the @-@ scen@@ es support for the attack came from the East Turk@@ est@@ an Islamic Movement ( E@@ TI@@ M ) based in central and western Asia , &quot; declared the head of the Chinese security services to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video posted online on Thursday evening .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ zh@@ u , a member of the Policy Bureau of the Commun@@ ist Party of China ( CPC ) made the statement in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent while on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time that a senior Chinese official has named a specific organisation following the attack on Monday .
According to Chinese police , three members of one U@@ igh@@ ur family from the predominantly Muslim region of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , which shares borders with a number of central Asian countries , dro@@ ve a car loaded with c@@ ans of petro@@ l against the entrance of the For@@ bid@@ den City in Beijing , in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured .
The driver of the vehicle , his wife and his mother all died in the fire in the car .
E@@ TI@@ M , which is fighting for independence for East Turk@@ est@@ an - the former name of Chinese X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang - was classified by the UN@@ O in 2002 as one of the organisations affiliated with Al @-@ Qaida .
The movement is often bl@@ amed by Chinese authorities for sporadi@@ c trouble in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , although many experts cast doubt on its true influence .
George Ker@@ ev@@ an : Europe break @-@ up gives Sco@@ ts choice
Another day , another independence sc@@ are story .
This time we are war@@ ned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe @-@ wide free @-@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership .
C@@ ue stories about passport controls at Ber@@ wick and a barb@@ ed wire border along Had@@ ri@@ an &apos;s Wall .
Tr@@ ue , the Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of Europe , though - predic@@ tably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines .
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time b@@ ending their formal rules if it suits them .
Since Scotland isn &apos;t in the Schengen area now , continued non @-@ compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Sco@@ ts .
So , a non @-@ story , then .
And one that is so long in the to@@ oth it has become fossi@@ lis@@ ed : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a wh@@ is@@ k@@ ery old tale .
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe &apos;s bidding , any@@ way ?
Why trade London &apos;s y@@ oke for that of Brussels , especially now ?
Here is the real European news : the great , post @-@ war plan to un@@ ite Europe has finally st@@ alled .
With the euro crisis , Project Europe is officially dead .
Across the EU , parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to sc@@ rapp@@ ing the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from no@@ where to gr@@ ab nearly five million votes in September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively kno@@ c@@ king the Free Dem@@ ocr@@ ats ( equivalent to our own Li@@ b D@@ ems ) out of the Bundes@@ tag .
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has proved a watershed .
The au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the str@@ ait@@ jack@@ et imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece .
Rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of domestic currency de@@ valuation , southern Europe finds itself with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ à @-@ vis Germany .
The only recourse is to sl@@ ash wages and public spending - sp@@ urred on by Berlin .
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity mal@@ aise .
As a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
That is a crip@@ pling cost disadvantage , as we &apos;ve already seen at Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
All the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the European petro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ m@@ ered by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , re@@ vol@@ t is bre@@ wing , especially in France , once the EU &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader .
After the war , the French political el@@ ite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the bat@@ tered French economy stru@@ ggling .
Result : Marine Le P@@ en &apos;s right @-@ wing , anti @-@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by @-@ election , kno@@ c@@ king the ruling Soci@@ alists into third place .
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
What is Le P@@ en doing with her new@@ found popul@@ arity among the French white , working class ?
She wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to create an anti @-@ EU , anti @-@ common currency bloc across the European Parliament .
If , as is very possible , anti @-@ EU parties do well in these elections , such a bloc could domin@@ ate the European Parliament for the first time .
Here &apos;s my point : some@@ time soon growing anti @-@ EU and anti @-@ common currency feeling in Europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro .
The EU won &apos;t dis@@ appear , but it will re@@ vert to something more like the lo@@ ose &quot; Europe of the ( So@@ vere@@ ign ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de Gau@@ lle .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revi@@ ve their own currencies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hop@@ ing to cosy up to the US .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
Where does this leave Scotland ?
We can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off .
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
Co @-@ operation with other like @-@ min@@ ded countries will be easier in a non @-@ federal Europe of the Nations .
Otherwise we should consider em@@ ul@@ ating Norway and retaining our economic independence .
The SN@@ P government in Scotland is - remark@@ ab@@ ly@@ -- the most successful anti @-@ au@@ ster@@ ity political movement in Europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour &apos;s ch@@ ancell@@ or Al@@ ist@@ air Dar@@ ling and the subsequent T@@ ory @-@ Li@@ b De@@ m coalition .
It would be ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Early pub@@ er@@ ty : Gro@@ wing older so@@ oner
African @-@ American and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts , research shows .
Physical changes don &apos;t mean pub@@ er@@ ty is imminent
There &apos;s no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to bl@@ ame
Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early pub@@ er@@ ty
The trend toward early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced with boys
Former CN@@ N correspondent Pat E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journalist speci@@ alizing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
Should a mother be al@@ armed if her daughter begins to s@@ pro@@ ut breast bu@@ ds and pub@@ ic hair at 7 or 8 ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pe@@ di@@ a@@ trics this week in Or@@ land@@ o , Florida , pedi@@ atric endocr@@ in@@ ologist Dr. Paul Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm .
&quot; I spend a lot of time re@@ assur@@ ing parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progression into full pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; said Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z .
Ob@@ vious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding bre@@ asts , pub@@ ic and under@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appearing so@@ oner in girls .
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 1970 .
&quot; Once bre@@ asts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z , also author of &quot; Early Pu@@ ber@@ ty in Girls : The Essential Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Problem . &quot;
Time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty is going to progress .
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; pre@@ co@@ ci@@ ous &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ ur@@ t before age 8 .
In most cases , the process will slow down or st@@ all -- something a pedi@@ atr@@ ician can monitor closely .
A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocr@@ in@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : premature aging of the b@@ ones that ultimately can lead to st@@ un@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
Psy@@ cho@@ social aspects are important , too .
Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z is cau@@ tious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty may alleviate behavi@@ oral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from peers . &quot;
The other big issue is understandable : Parents simply don &apos;t want their very young d@@ augh@@ ters having periods .
&quot; They wor@@ ry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z .
&quot; It was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
Even though there were signs and we had tal@@ ked about men@@ str@@ uation , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She came home from school sc@@ ared and up@@ set to be the first among her friends .
There are lots of well @-@ publici@@ zed the@@ ories about the causes of pre@@ co@@ ci@@ ous pub@@ er@@ ty .
Yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to bl@@ ame .
Bo@@ ys - like girls - are h@@ itting pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
Ka@@ plo@@ wit@@ z contends the pre@@ mise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity .
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9 @-@ year @-@ old girls that links body fat to the timing of pub@@ er@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
In this country , African @-@ American and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts .
There are varying explanations .
Glob@@ ally , patterns of early pub@@ er@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
Another con@@ un@@ dru@@ m : Although boys are getting fac@@ ial and pub@@ ic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full @-@ b@@ low@@ n early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .
Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complex@@ ities of the topic .

Co@@ en Bro@@ thers &apos; Hom@@ age to Fol@@ k Music
&quot; In@@ side L@@ le@@ w@@ yn Davis &quot; by the Co@@ en brothers , winners of the Grand Prix at the last Can@@ nes Film Festival , is a no@@ stal@@ gic com@@ edy set in Green@@ wich Village in 1961 and based on folk music , which was just bud@@ ding there prior to the arrival of Bob D@@ yl@@ an .
Jo@@ el and E@@ than Co@@ en , whose fil@@ mo@@ graphy has recently been the subject of a review at the &quot; C@@ iné@@ ma@@ th@@ èque française &quot; , s@@ coop@@ ed the Pal@@ me d &apos;@@ Or at Can@@ nes in 1991 with Bar@@ ton Fin@@ k .
Since they could not hire D@@ yl@@ an or the Peter , Paul and Mary tri@@ o , Jo@@ el and E@@ than Co@@ en op@@ ted for a rising American movie star , O@@ sc@@ ar Is@@ a@@ ac , aged 33 , and global pop star Jus@@ tin Tim@@ ber@@ lake .
In this film bur@@ sting with hum@@ our , where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live , O@@ sc@@ ar Is@@ a@@ ac proved himself to be an accomplished folk mus@@ ician and sing@@ er , while Tim@@ ber@@ lake , his friend in the film , aband@@ ons pop for folk music with contag@@ ious g@@ lee .
Care@@ y Mul@@ lig@@ an , in turn , aband@@ ons the we@@ alth@@ y tr@@ app@@ ings of D@@ ais@@ y Bu@@ chan@@ an in &quot; The Great G@@ at@@ s@@ by &quot; for less gl@@ it@@ zy clothes ; her sing@@ ing voice is soft , but her language very co@@ ar@@ se when she speaks .
&quot; In@@ side L@@ le@@ w@@ yn Davis &quot; tells the story of a week of trib@@ ulations for a folk sing@@ er who has failed to get a break and is an@@ gr@@ y with the whole world .
He reluc@@ t@@ antly accepts last minute stand @-@ in roles at studios .
With no@@ where to live , he sle@@ eps on the couches of friends who will still have him .
Docum@@ entary @-@ style
&quot; His relationship with success is tor@@ tured , and that &apos;s what interested us : a mix of bad luc@@ k and a gu@@ y who &apos;s never in the right place at the right time , not career @-@ orient@@ ated , but honest , with a tendency towards self @-@ destruction , &quot; E@@ than Co@@ en , who , with his brother Jo@@ el , has won several Os@@ cars and Can@@ nes pri@@ zes , told the press .
Even though L@@ le@@ w@@ yn Davis never existed , the two directors , who are folk music fans , based their story on real people of the time , such as folk mus@@ ician Dave Van Ron@@ k .
The idea was to portr@@ ay the moment preceding the ad@@ vent of Green@@ wich Village , the New York district destined to become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ entre of the folk music boom that created international stars &quot; , according to the journalist Eli@@ j@@ ah W@@ ald , a friend of Van Ron@@ k .
The film has the feel of a documentary , from the fu@@ st@@ y record label over@@ run with un@@ sold L@@ Ps and inhab@@ ited by a pr@@ ic@@ eless old secretary , to the musical choices of the studios of the day and the caf@@ és where the sing@@ ers performed .
The Co@@ en brothers &apos; mag@@ ic continues to work by integrating a com@@ ical character who is permanently on screen : a magnificent , cu@@ te g@@ inger cat who is L@@ le@@ w@@ yn Davis &apos; comp@@ anion in fate .
Asked how he had developed his character , the actor and sing@@ er Jus@@ tin Tim@@ ber@@ lake recalled how he &quot; grew up in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see , bath@@ ed in the b@@ lues and country music &quot; .
&quot; My first music lessons were given to me by my grand@@ father . He taught me to play the guit@@ ar , &quot; he added .
Tim@@ ber@@ lake says that although you have to work &quot; to be considered good ... luc@@ k can also launch your career ... more and more so today &quot; .
Like L@@ le@@ w@@ yn Davis , who ref@@ uses to compromise on his music , the pop star says that in a career , &quot; the most important thing is to avoid getting tr@@ apped by things that prevent us from expressing ourselves &quot; .
Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , &quot; SAS &quot; Series Author , Di@@ es .
He never got to know the meaning of the word &quot; retirement &quot; .
Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , a phenomenon of the French writing world , who died on Thursday at 83 , had just published his 200@@ th &quot; SAS &quot; book , &quot; La V@@ eng@@ e@@ ance du K@@ rem@@ lin &quot; .
In February , the New York Times du@@ b@@ bed him &quot; the sp@@ y novel@@ ist who knew too much &quot; .
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan , the setting of numbers 198 and 199 of his celebrated sp@@ y novel series .
He had been in poor health since having a major heart attack in December 2010 , and , on this trip , he had been using a walking frame .
Prior to Afghanistan , he had also been to Lib@@ ya , Russia , Lebanon and Mali .
Ger@@ ard V@@ illi@@ ers , who was born on 8 December 1929 in Paris , published four SAS books every year , and said he did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of &quot; SAS à Istanbul &quot; , the first in the series , almost half a century ago in 1965 .
&quot; Prob@@ ably between 120 and 150 million , if you include every country , &quot; he conj@@ ectu@@ red last March .
In the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foc@@ h , just a short distance from the Ar@@ c de Tri@@ om@@ phe , with his Bur@@ m@@ ese cat on his k@@ nee and a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous tw@@ ink@@ le in his eye under the white hair , he listed some of the languages the adv@@ entures of SAS had been translated into : Italian , German , Russian , Greek , Japanese and Korean .
&quot; That &apos;s not counting the pir@@ ate publications , &quot; he added , pointing to a pile of books on the low table , between the bronze and iv@@ ory artefacts collected from the 130 countries he had surveyed for the settings of his no@@ vels .
At the price of a pack@@ et of cigarettes , the reader gets a book bearing the traditional cover , featuring a photo of a young woman with an ample bo@@ so@@ m , carrying a pist@@ ol or an assault ri@@ fle .
In@@ side , His Ser@@ ene High@@ ness ( SAS ) Prince Mal@@ ko Lin@@ ge , a p@@ enn@@ il@@ ess Austrian ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ at and contract agent for the CIA ( to pay the bills for repai@@ ring the family man@@ sion ) , is hot on the he@@ els of all the world &apos;s evi@@ l @-@ do@@ ers - commun@@ ists in the 7@@ 0s and 8@@ 0s , then ji@@ h@@ ad@@ ists since the 9@@ 0s .
Each book follows the same formula : a large dose of geo@@ politics and the exo@@ tic , several r@@ acy sex scen@@ es , a touch of violence and torture .
&quot; I never made any claim to being an author of great literature , &quot; explained Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers .
&quot; I think of myself as a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller who writ@@ es to enter@@ tain people , not send them a message . &quot;
He worked &quot; like the great pre @-@ war re@@ porters , in the lik@@ es of Albert Londres , who went on location and came back with proper , lengthy investigations . &quot;
The cre@@ ator of SAS said he was &quot; making a sort of geo@@ political so@@ ap oper@@ a &quot; .
&quot; I follow up my files ( on Afghanistan , Syria etc ) constantly before setting off , &quot; added de V@@ illi@@ ers .
On location , I meet journalists , including those of the AF@@ P , diplom@@ ats , and services staff , some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years .
As a result , some of his SAS no@@ vels have been pre@@ monit@@ ory : a month before an attack on a command centre of the Syrian government , in which several senior officials were killed , he had already told the story in &quot; Le Chem@@ in de D@@ amas &quot; .
In &quot; Les F@@ ous de Ben@@ gh@@ azi &quot; , he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in the city , the cr@@ ad@@ le of the Libyan re@@ vol@@ t .
In 1980 , he described the assass@@ ination of Egyptian president An@@ war S@@ ad@@ at in &quot; Le com@@ plot du Caire &quot; a year before the attack .
In October 2012 , in &quot; Pan@@ ique à Bam@@ ako &quot; , he mentioned columns of 4@@ x@@ 4@@ s of ji@@ h@@ ad@@ ists swe@@ eping towards the M@@ alian capital .
&quot; I &apos;m no se@@ er , &quot; Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers would say in his defence . &quot; I simply make conj@@ ec@@ tures based on countries that I know well and , occasionally , some of my conj@@ ec@@ tures come true . &quot;
After travelling to - often troubl@@ ed - zones , he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM d@@ ais@@ y wheel ty@@ pe@@ writer , &quot; every part of which has been replaced &quot; .
300 pages later , he would write the words &quot; The End &quot; and correct each page by hand .
On the walls of his office h@@ ang AK @-@ 47 assault ri@@ f@@ les , ero@@ tic photos and photos of the author with African war l@@ ords .
De V@@ illi@@ ers was regularly critic@@ ised by femin@@ ist groups for male ch@@ auv@@ in@@ ism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismis@@ s in two sentences :
&quot; Some women in my books are sex objects , others are beautiful , intelligent , br@@ ave women .
I have always been well @-@ received in Africa , where I have a very large number of readers . &quot;
Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers said it himself : &quot; Like all her@@ oes , Mal@@ ko Lin@@ ge is ag@@ eless .
He will not die and will not retire .
Any more than I will . &quot;
Jet makers feu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has f@@ lared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist @-@ class seats on long @-@ distance flights , setting the tone for a bit@@ ter confrontation at this month &apos;s Dub@@ ai Air@@ show .
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long @-@ haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Bo@@ eing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its U.S. ar@@ ch @-@ rival Bo@@ eing says it should be for airlines to decide .
The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever @-@ larger versions of their twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17 @-@ 21 event .
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini @-@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; jet designs .
Bo@@ eing says its rev@@ amped &quot; 77@@ 7@@ X &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Airbus says the competing version of its A@@ 350 will carry 350 people in 18 @-@ in@@ ch @-@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast .
Pl@@ ane gi@@ ants often trade b@@ lows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
Now , Airbus is appe@@ aling directly to the public ahead of the Dub@@ ai Air@@ show , where the 77@@ 7@@ X is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
It recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustr@@ ating three people squ@@ ashed together at a restaurant , ti@@ tled &quot; Would You Ac@@ cept This ? &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ eing is proposing long @-@ distance flying in seats narrow@@ er than regional turb@@ o @-@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Le@@ ah@@ y .
As di@@ ets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not rad@@ ically changed .
Between the early 1970s , when the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o defined modern long @-@ haul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 49 @-@ year @-@ old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .
The w@@ ais@@ t of the average 21st @-@ century American male is 39.@@ 7 in@@ ches , according to U.S. health statistics .
Airbus says its rival is stic@@ king to a seat concept from the 19@@ 50s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly ch@@ ris@@ tened &quot; jet set &quot; was narrow@@ er .
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra in@@ ch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Bo@@ eing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
It also says research shows cab@@ in experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Bo@@ eing cab@@ ins expert Kent Cr@@ aver .
They don &apos;t want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them profitable .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700 @-@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports .
As R@@ eu@@ ters first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
Both Airbus and Bo@@ eing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin @-@ eng@@ ined long @-@ haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365 @-@ seat Bo@@ eing 777 @-@ 300@@ ER .
Bo@@ eing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast 77@@ 7@@ X with an original 9 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast 777 design .
The gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use .
&quot; The reason Bo@@ eing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kevin Ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .
On the other hand , analysts say full 10 @-@ seat @-@ per @-@ row cab@@ ins for existing 77@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the dens@@ er layout , which may go hand in hand with che@@ aper fares .
&quot; Eigh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cab@@ in inter@@ iors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the R@@ un@@ way Gir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
Globe @-@ tro@@ tting jet s@@ ellers even carry tape measures to check on competing lay@@ outs .
While bo@@ asting comfort , all buil@@ ders also offer jets with high @-@ density lay@@ outs for low @-@ cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus offers a 10 @-@ ab@@ re@@ ast A@@ 350 but says it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus was stressing the need for more cab@@ in custom@@ ization by offering wider ais@@ le seats on some of its jets .
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could dis@@ tract from a wave of 77@@ 7@@ X sales .
Or@@ acle Sh@@ are@@ holders An@@ gr@@ y at El@@ lison Salary
A majority of shareholders at Or@@ acle voted against the proposed remuneration package for founder and managing director Larry El@@ lison on Thursday in view of his group &apos;s financial performance .
The vote is not binding , but it does tar@@ nish the image of El@@ lison , the third rich@@ est man in the world , who is still re@@ vel@@ ling in his boat &apos;s victory in the Americas Cup .
The multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the capital in the software group he co @-@ founded 40 years ago .
Just last year , El@@ lison got a negative vote on his remuneration package .
The Or@@ acle bo@@ ss rel@@ inqu@@ ished a $ 1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year , which ended in May , because of the group &apos;s poor performances . The group had failed to meet its growth targets , but he did pick up around $ 77 million linked to stock options .
His fixed salary is a nominal $ 1 .
Throughout the non @-@ calendar 2013 fiscal year , Or@@ acle &apos;s net profit grew by 3.5 % , while its share price rose 2@@ 7.5 % , out@@ performing the S &amp; P @-@ 500 index which grew 24 % in the same period .
New anti @-@ nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti @-@ nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette .
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .
Further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ronald Cry@@ st@@ al of We@@ ill Corn@@ ell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
&quot; We are very hop@@ eful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Pro@@ f Corn@@ ell said .
The new vaccine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti @-@ nicotine anti@@ bodies .
The virus sel@@ ecti@@ vely inf@@ ects liver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloo@@ d@@ stream , neutr@@ alising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a nicotine hit .
In tests , vacc@@ inated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity .
But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot; ch@@ illed out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached their br@@ ains .
The experiments are described in the journal Science Trans@@ l@@ ational Medicine .
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels top@@ ped up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it turns liver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
Pro@@ f Cry@@ st@@ al said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a cigarette , preventing nicotine addiction .
But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit .
&quot; They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them k@@ ick the hab@@ it , &quot; he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but war@@ ned far more research was needed .
Dr@@ one K@@ ills Pak@@ ist@@ ani Taliban Leader
The leader of the Pak@@ ist@@ ani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ sud , was killed in an American dr@@ one strike in Pakistan on Friday , according to security services .
H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ sud &apos;s death has been announced several times before in the past .
However , intelligence personnel , army staff and political activists have confirmed this time that he has lost his life in the strike , which was carried out in the region of North W@@ az@@ ir@@ istan .
&quot; We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ sud has been killed in a dr@@ one strike , &quot; said a senior security services official .
The previous day , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani Prime Minister , N@@ aw@@ az Sh@@ ari@@ f , informed the British government on a trip to London that discussions had been initiated with Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Taliban Pakistan ( T@@ TP ) , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ be@@ id
Former NS@@ W Labor minister Joe Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state &apos;s corruption watch@@ dog .
Former NS@@ W minister Joe Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three properties on government @-@ controlled land .
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( IC@@ AC ) on Friday wid@@ ened its inquiry into whether Mr O@@ be@@ id lob@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have leases at Circular Qu@@ ay , where the O@@ be@@ ids owned two restaurants and a caf@@ e , renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005 .
It &apos;s now investigating allegations Mr Tri@@ po@@ di knew of Mr O@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former deputy chief of staff , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ pole , on Thursday .
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been push@@ ing for the leases to go to public tender .
The les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
In 2009 leases for the Circular Qu@@ ay enterprises , which earned the O@@ be@@ ids about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public tenders .
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ id , who Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was urg@@ ing a shift in government lease policy .
A phone trans@@ cript tabled in IC@@ AC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Steve Dun@@ n , a senior bureauc@@ rat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr O@@ be@@ id in the fisheries department .
&quot; Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy , &quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whe@@ al@@ y asked Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; No , &quot; Mr Tri@@ po@@ di replied .
I can &apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely was@@ n &apos;t that .
De@@ fin@@ itely not between myself and Mr O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli war@@ planes attack target inside Syria , official says
Israeli war@@ planes struck a target inside the Syrian port city of Lat@@ akia Thursday night , a senior administration official confirms to Fox News .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
The Associated Press reports the target was Russian @-@ made SA @-@ 125 missiles .
At least twice earlier this year Israel launched air@@ strikes on shipments of missiles inside Syria .
Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test
A &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contempl@@ ates expanding a cr@@ ack@@ down .
The test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7@@ s being used to fill un@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Max@@ ine McK@@ ew sl@@ am@@ med the government &apos;s rh@@ et@@ oric about foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; Lou@@ d declarations about &apos; foreigners getting to the back of the queue &apos; and &apos; A@@ ussi@@ e jobs first &apos; are a very un@@ pleasant thro@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
Hist@@ orically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echo@@ es of that historic arti@@ fact , I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be surpris@@ ed .
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bow@@ en .
Immigration Minister Br@@ end@@ an O &apos;@@ Connor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration .
If the &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scru@@ tin@@ ised about &quot; whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nom@@ ine@@ e is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business . &quot;
Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Sri Lan@@ kan asylum see@@ ker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week .
The man &apos;s dis@@ trau@@ ght nine @-@ year @-@ old son travelled to Australia with him and has been com@@ for@@ ted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cou@@ sin who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities r@@ ush@@ ed the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .
A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .
The work by HS@@ 2 Ltd suggests high @-@ speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 20@@ 26 .
Transport minister Bar@@ on@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .
Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Man@@ chester and Le@@ eds .
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high @-@ speed link between London and the North of England from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ bn to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ bn .
The UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instructed HS@@ 2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Ed@@ in@@ burgh to London of three hours or less .
Bar@@ on@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said : &quot; Our goal for HS@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;
We are driving forward HS@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
But it is also about connectivity , across the UK 18 cities including G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Ed@@ in@@ burgh will be better connected because of HS@@ 2 .
Scottish Secretary Al@@ ist@@ air Carm@@ ich@@ ael added : &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
For the Scottish government , Keith Brown called on Mr Carm@@ ich@@ ael to &quot; unequi@@ voc@@ ally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the HS@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &quot; High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;
So we are exc@@ ited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and compl@@ ementing the G@@ las@@ go@@ w @-@ Ed@@ in@@ burgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tab@@ lets and smart phones during take @-@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e @-@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; air@@ plane &quot; mode .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying to be unable to access their e @-@ books during take @-@ offs and land@@ ings .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
&quot; C@@ ASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , which has already been talking to C@@ ASA about extending the use its in @-@ flight wi @-@ fi entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator .
&quot; We would welcome a review by C@@ ASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in @-@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take @-@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
The FAA ruling applies to American airlines .
However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
For US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .
Carri@@ ers will need to prove their planes can toler@@ ate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals , training materials , carry @-@ on baggage programs and passenger briefings .
&quot; Once an airline veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use hand@@ held , light@@ weight electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e @-@ readers , and s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones @-@ at all alti@@ tudes , &quot; the FAA said .
In rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruc@@ t passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
The group also recommended that he@@ avier devices should be safely st@@ owed under seats or in overhead b@@ ins during take @-@ off and landing .
P@@ ia : At Least Four In@@ jured in Viol@@ ent Sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ h
The small town of P@@ ia experienced an unusual height of fever on Thursday evening .
This involved three police vehicles , two ambul@@ ances and a group of about thirty people , according to reports .
This day of Hal@@ lo@@ ween , P@@ ia had a troubl@@ ed evening marked by the outbreak of a bra@@ wl involving a number of people around the post office .
Reports say at least four people were slightly injured .
The police , who had been aler@@ ted , step@@ ped in to separate the bel@@ lig@@ er@@ ents and make sure that the injured received medical attention .
P@@ aw@@ n@@ brokers sh@@ ine in Singapore as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
At a p@@ aw@@ n@@ shop in B@@ endem@@ e@@ er shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani A@@ mir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a is sw@@ apping a gold b@@ angle , ring and pair of ear@@ rings to pay her d@@ augh@@ ters &quot; school fees .
&quot; My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s st@@ uck there , &quot; Mrs A@@ mir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a says .
Even though she ear@@ ns S $ 3,000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
Indeed , such is demand across parts of sou@@ theast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Val@@ ue@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third p@@ aw@@ n@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
P@@ aw@@ ning jew@@ ell@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,@@ 300 in Ms A@@ mir@@ thal@@ ing@@ a &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
Typ@@ ically p@@ aw@@ n@@ brokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.@@ 4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank , a local l@@ ender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
However , p@@ aw@@ n@@ brokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
Hence millions of people across the region are turning to p@@ aw@@ n@@ shops as families feel the squ@@ ee@@ ze from rising living costs and bal@@ lo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by lo@@ ose monetary policy in advanced economies , low@@ er@@ - and middle @-@ income families are turning to p@@ awn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
This week Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , the rating agency , cited increasing household leverage , mainly from rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; cre@@ dit@@ worth@@ iness .
It said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia .
Malaysia top@@ ped the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists are also wor@@ ri@@ ed about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week narrow@@ ly emerged from technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a so@@ f@@ tening in consumer demand .
&quot; Bot@@ tom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , &quot; says S@@ ong Sen@@ g W@@ un , econom@@ ist at CI@@ MB , a Malay@@ sian bank .
Hist@@ orically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the r@@ ush to p@@ awn personal belong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jew@@ ell@@ ery .
In Singapore , about 70 per cent of items p@@ aw@@ ned at the city @-@ state &apos;s 200 p@@ awn outlets are gold .
People are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s p@@ awn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .
In Thailand the largest p@@ aw@@ n@@ shop operator , E@@ asy@@ Money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months .
Such is the growth in the p@@ awn business that Val@@ ue@@ Max , operator of the outlet at B@@ endem@@ e@@ er and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Ye@@ ah Lee Ch@@ ing , Val@@ ue@@ Max &apos;s executive director .
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 66@@ m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .
While some discount l@@ enders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Ye@@ ah says that not only does p@@ aw@@ ning offer che@@ aper rates than other l@@ enders , it also does not add directly to debt .
&quot; Cust@@ omers are mort@@ g@@ aging items that they already own , and mon@@ e@@ tis@@ ing personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
There &apos;s an increased social acceptance of p@@ aw@@ n@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
Nor are the types of people who use p@@ aw@@ n@@ brokers only the financially stret@@ ched .
We@@ alth@@ y people in Singapore also use Val@@ ue@@ Max outlets , p@@ aw@@ ning gold bars or Rol@@ ex wat@@ ches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
We see customers from all walks of life .
&quot; They include we@@ alth@@ y individuals who need to bor@@ row short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Ye@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly .
Minister Acc@@ used of Child Por@@ no@@ graphy in Nova Scotia
A minister who was in charge of children in the area of Halifax , Nova Scotia , has been accused of child pornography .
Aar@@ on Hu@@ dg@@ ins , aged 30 , was arrested on Friday morning following a search at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works .
Tim@@ ber@@ lay Bapti@@ st Church , where he offici@@ ated as minister , said it was deeply s@@ add@@ ened by the news .
In a statement , church officials said that Mr Hu@@ dg@@ ins had re@@ signed from his post .
The minister has been condi@@ tionally released .
To be specific , he is not allowed to communicate with anyone under 18 or to access the Internet .
He shall appear before the provincial court in Halifax in December .
Man W@@ ear@@ ing N@@ azi Uniform Ch@@ ased A@@ way from Super@@ market
A man dress@@ ed in a N@@ azi uniform with a sw@@ as@@ ti@@ ka arm@@ band was asked to leave a British super@@ market following complaints by customers to the manager of the shop , who called the police , according to the shop on Friday .
&quot; We received a number of complaints from customers , so we asked him to leave the shop , &quot; explained a spo@@ kes@@ person for the As@@ da chain of super@@ markets .
The shop called the police for assistance , but &quot; by the time they arrived he had already left without making a scene , &quot; she added .
&quot; I was qu@@ eu@@ ing when I saw a woman who seemed very up@@ set .
People were fl@@ ab@@ berg@@ asted .
You don &apos;t go out in public dress@@ ed like that unless you want to attract attention , &quot; said one customer , Ros@@ ina Ru@@ sin , 60 , to the Cambridge News .
The incident occurred on Thursday - Hal@@ lo@@ ween - when it is customary to d@@ ress up as a mon@@ ster , but it is hard to believe that this was a ho@@ ax .
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his T@@ wit@@ ter account , where he posted pictures of Adol@@ f Hit@@ ler .
&quot; I have been wearing a black SS arm@@ band in As@@ da twice a week for three years , &quot; claimed Paul Dut@@ ton , explaining that he was suffering from &quot; mental problems &quot; .
$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ assi@@ e health
The Federal Government ins@@ ists a $ 325 million rescue package for T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s ailing health system has tou@@ gh conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;t waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister Tan@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
The funding , over four years , was decided after government consultations with T@@ as@@ mani@@ an independent MP Andrew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today .
The $ 325 million package includes a $ 31 million el@@ ective surgery bl@@ itz .
An additional 26@@ 00 operations including orth@@ op@@ edi@@ c and cat@@ ar@@ act surgery will help clear a backlog .
There &apos;s also money for walk @-@ in clinics in H@@ ob@@ art and Laun@@ c@@ est@@ on , better after @-@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; These investments respond to the ideas that front @-@ line clin@@ icians have told me will be the best ways to tend to T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
The minister ins@@ isted the T@@ as@@ mani@@ an Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
A three @-@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie today said the $ 325 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing . &quot;
He nevertheless pr@@ ais@@ ed the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I &apos;m hop@@ eful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said .
According to the State Government these additional el@@ ective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But federal Opposition health spo@@ kes@@ man Peter Dut@@ ton believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; band @-@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ri@@ pped $ 430 million out of its health system , &quot; he told ABC TV .
You can &apos;t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half @-@ a @-@ billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $ 300 million and pre@@ tend it &apos;s a good news day .
Mr Dut@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureauc@@ r@@ acy .

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , watch@@ dog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and po@@ ison gas munitions , the global chemical weapons watch@@ dog said Thursday as fi@@ erce cl@@ ashes r@@ aged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored .
Also Thursday , a Syrian acti@@ vist group said more than 12@@ 0,000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov .
1 deadline set by The Hague @-@ based organization for Dam@@ asc@@ us to destroy or &quot; render in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into po@@ ison gas and filling munitions .
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious tim@@ eline that aims to destroy all of Dam@@ asc@@ us &apos; chemical weapons by mid @-@ 2014 .
Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ asc@@ us still has to start destro@@ ying existing weapons and stock@@ piles .
The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ ve agent sar@@ in .
The announcement came as fighting r@@ aged Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fir@@ a , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Britain @-@ based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .
The acti@@ vist group , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , said Thursday that 12@@ 0,@@ 296 people have died .
Of those , it said 6@@ 1,0@@ 67 are civilians , including 6,@@ 365 children .
On the government side , it said 29,@@ 954 are members of President B@@ ash@@ ar Ass@@ ad &apos;s armed forces , 18,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro @-@ government fighters and 187 are Lebanese He@@ zb@@ ollah militants .
Also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 202 army def@@ ec@@ tors and some 5,@@ 375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
On July 25 , the U.@@ N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated that figure since .
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country .
Ass@@ ad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling reb@@ els , many of them linked to al @-@ Qaida groups , in Sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks .
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specific@@ s .
The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the mid@@ st of an ongoing civil war .
A statement from the O@@ PC@@ W , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria &apos;s declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment . &quot;
It added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ asc@@ us .
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspectors said .
On Thursday , O@@ PC@@ W said the two locations were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were inspected . &quot;
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two sites that O@@ PC@@ W inspectors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the O@@ PC@@ W &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the forti@@ tude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the watch@@ dog &apos;s director @-@ general , Ah@@ met U@@ z@@ um@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the O@@ PC@@ W .
Now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sun@@ ni Muslim reb@@ els against Ass@@ ad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are st@@ acked with members of his A@@ law@@ ite sect , an off@@ shoot of Shi@@ ite Islam .
In other developments , the Observatory &apos;s chief R@@ ami Ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Lat@@ akia .
The cause of the bl@@ ast was not known , he said .
An@@ ger over Bali bom@@ b pl@@ ot@@ ter &apos;s sentence
Sur@@ viv@@ ors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bomb@@ ing have re@@ acted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the pl@@ ot@@ ters to face justice , saying U@@ mar Pat@@ ek should face a fir@@ ing squ@@ ad .
Pat@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South @-@ East Asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in j@@ ail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bomb@@ ing .
He could be released within 15 years if granted parole .
The 45 @-@ year @-@ old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two ni@@ ght@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of Ku@@ ta which left 202 people dead , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and injured scores more .
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism @-@ related charges , including a wave of bomb@@ ings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas E@@ ve in 2000 .
Prosecu@@ tors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; Dem@@ oli@@ tion Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bom@@ b @-@ maker be sentenced to death .
The decision has re@@ ign@@ ited pain@@ ful mem@@ ories for Per@@ th mother June Cor@@ teen , who lost her 39 @-@ year @-@ old twin d@@ augh@@ ters Jane and J@@ enn@@ y in the destruction un@@ le@@ ashed by Pat@@ ek and his co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
Figh@@ ting back te@@ ars , she said Pat@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; He should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen told AAP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children , and my d@@ augh@@ ters .
The Sar@@ i Club was level@@ led when a massive bom@@ b loaded into a van par@@ ked outside was det@@ on@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in Pad@@ dy &apos;s Bar where a suicide bom@@ ber det@@ on@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
He lap@@ sed into a month @-@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bomb@@ ing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
Mr Hughes said Pat@@ ek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ zi , Mu@@ kh@@ las and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dra - who were executed four years ago .
Re@@ ally , this gu@@ y should get the death penalty before any@@ body .
To keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
To get 20 years , after killing 202 people and injur@@ ing many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
Pat@@ ek is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to face justice .
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually appre@@ h@@ ended in January 2011 in the Pak@@ ist@@ ani town of Abbot@@ tab@@ ad , where US forces killed former al @-@ Q@@ a@@ eda chief O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden less than four months later .
During the trial , an F@@ BI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Pat@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re @-@ establish links between South @-@ East Asian terrorist groups and al @-@ Q@@ a@@ eda .
&quot; He didn &apos;t give himself up , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
Until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sor@@ ry for how much grief he caused other people .
The ver@@ dict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia .
&quot; There will be a lot of te@@ ars this year , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
Pat@@ ek may yet appeal his sentence .
FAA : Air passengers can now use gad@@ gets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
Air@@ line passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate @-@ to @-@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under much @-@ anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers shoul@@ dn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FAA Administrator Michael Hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference .
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their air@@ planes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for st@@ owing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .
Delta and J@@ et@@ Blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans .
&quot; Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA said in a statement .
Currently , passengers are required to turn off their s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door closes .
They &apos;re not supposed to rest@@ art them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the cap@@ tain gives the go @-@ ahead .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not rest@@ art them until the plane is on the ground .
Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during tak@@ e@@ offs , land@@ ings and tax@@ i@@ ing , the FAA said .
Most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi@@ fi at higher alti@@ tudes are expected to meet the criteria .
Laura Gl@@ ading , president of the Association of Professional Flight At@@ tend@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win @-@ win , &quot; Gl@@ ading said in a statement .
We &apos;re fr@@ ank@@ ly ti@@ red of feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But connecting to the Internet to sur@@ f , exchange em@@ ails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will be told to switch their s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to air@@ plane mode .
So , still no Wor@@ ds With Friends , the online S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble @-@ type game that actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his s@@ mar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously bo@@ oted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate .
And he@@ avier devices such as lap@@ t@@ ops will continue to have to be st@@ owed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cab@@ in .
In @-@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FAA .
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during tak@@ e@@ off and landing
Last month , National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosen@@ ker , a CBS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; Cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the FCC , that it could interfere with cell phone tow@@ ers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; Rosen@@ ker said .
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ . Claire McC@@ ask@@ ill , D @-@ Mo . , con@@ tend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions .
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
The FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios , the high @-@ tech gad@@ gets of their day .
New air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .
Airlines have been offering Wi @-@ Fi use at cru@@ ising alti@@ tudes to passengers for several years .
Pl@@ anes modified for Wi @-@ Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
The vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Hu@@ er@@ ta said .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices .
E @-@ readers , for example , em@@ it only minimal transmissions when turning a page .
But transmissions are stronger when devices are down@@ loading or sending data .
Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been Amaz@@ on@@ .com .
In 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ lin@@ er full of their K@@ ind@@ le e @-@ readers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none .
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Douglas Kid@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line Pass@@ eng@@ ers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
Other committee members said there are only an@@ ecd@@ otal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
However , the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low visibility .
A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common @-@ sense accommodations for a trav@@ eling public now br@@ ist@@ ling with technology .
&quot; We &apos;re pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoy@@ able passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , &quot; said Roger D@@ ow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
Bird air@@ lifted to safety from North Sea ri@@ g released back into wild
A bird air@@ lifted ash@@ ore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil ri@@ g has been released back into the wild .
The water rail was put on a helicopter to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scottish S@@ PCA at its rescue centre in Al@@ lo@@ a .
Centre manager Colin S@@ ed@@ don said : &quot; This water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil ri@@ g .
He added : &quot; It was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help . &quot;
The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
Is Europe &apos;s el@@ ite ready to do business with Britain ?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .
To that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .
You@@ Go@@ v pol@@ led over 1,000 business leaders , broadly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many .
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing while the EU states stag@@ n@@ ate .
They want to see the Government priori@@ tise new trading links with the lik@@ es of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gg@@ ed down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the EU &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions .
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster .
There was general dis@@ content with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro @-@ European of companies , agreed .
Finally , and most tell@@ ingly of all , our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .
This finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is push@@ ing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .
The st@@ akes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent sw@@ ing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this poll shows that British business backs his plan for ren@@ e@@ goti@@ ating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that business expects that ren@@ e@@ goti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
A better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the euro@@ zone embar@@ ks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our poll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach .
United States D@@ ress@@ ed for Hal@@ lo@@ ween
US President Obama celebrated the tradition of Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
Y@@ esterday evening , he and his wife handed out swe@@ ets to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington .
Last year , Hal@@ lo@@ ween festi@@ vities on the east coast of the USA were cancelled because H@@ urricane Sand@@ y was on its way .
So this year , the mer@@ ry@@ makers made up for it .
In New York , thousands of people in cost@@ umes took part in the par@@ ade organised in the Green@@ wich Village district .
&quot; Everyone is super @-@ exc@@ ited , &quot; said Andrea , one of the participants .
&quot; I was able to wear the co@@ stu@@ me I had planned for last year . &quot;
&quot; Everyone is having a wild time , &quot; added Rh@@ onda .
&quot; People are happy .
It &apos;s relax@@ ed , it &apos;s cool .
We really need this . &quot;
Hal@@ lo@@ ween is a p@@ agan festival celebrated the day before All S@@ aints &apos; Day , principally in English @-@ speaking countries .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s Alex@@ ei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stre@@ am gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s chief said .
&quot; A land@@ mark event has taken place today : Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stre@@ am gas pipeline , the most large @-@ scale and important project in Europe , &quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m Chairman Alex@@ ei Miller said in a statement Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stre@@ am is meant to add diversity to Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counterparts in Ukraine , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means geo@@ political risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot; fore@@ ver . &quot;

Pit@@ c@@ airn to Create World &apos;s Larg@@ est Marine Reserve
Pit@@ c@@ airn Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in the world , daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de T@@ ah@@ iti announced on Thursday , following up on news from Radio Australia .
The island , which lies to the east of the G@@ ambi@@ er archi@@ pel@@ ago ( French Poly@@ n@@ esia ) , is the last British territory in the South Pacific , hal@@ f@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
The territory measures 47@@ km2 , including three other small islands nearby .
It has been British since its occupation by the B@@ oun@@ ty mu@@ tin@@ e@@ ers , an episo@@ de in British maritime history that has been turned into three Holl@@ ywood films .
Several do@@ zen inhabitants , the majority of them descendants of the B@@ oun@@ ty mu@@ tin@@ e@@ ers , still live on Pit@@ c@@ airn , with 95 % of their income depending on the gener@@ osity of London .
The island &apos;s Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archi@@ pel@@ ago . It will be 83@@ 6,@@ 000@@ km2 , corresponding to its exclusive economic zone .
An assistant to the may@@ or went to London to ask Great Britain to endorse this request .
Mike War@@ ren , the may@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ airn , believes that the creation of such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island .
The project will need to be ratified by the British govern@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ airn , who is based in New Zealand , and the British government .
Creating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 83@@ 6,@@ 000@@ km2 , provided it has the means to ensure it is polic@@ ed - which it does not .
There is no airport on Pit@@ c@@ airn , making it impossible to base one or more air@@ crafts there to monitor the zone , and there is no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed .
France , on her part , already has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the E@@ EZ of French Poly@@ n@@ esia , adjacent to Pit@@ c@@ airn .

Life S@@ ent@@ ence for Former Chinese Vice @-@ Governor
A former vice @-@ govern@@ or of the province of J@@ ili@@ n , in the nor@@ theast of China , sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday .
Having been exp@@ elled from the Commun@@ ist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of receiving 19 million yu@@ an in bri@@ bes , according to media officials in China .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the vice @-@ govern@@ or , who was also president of the Bank of J@@ ili@@ n , a public institution , helped businesses and managers win contracts , loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts , the Primary Inter@@ mediate Court in Beijing declared on its micro@@ blog .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , has made the fight against corruption a national priority , beli@@ eving that the phenomenon is a threat to the very existence of the Commun@@ ist Party .
The head of state has promised that justice would be just as in@@ flexible with the powerful &quot; ti@@ gers &quot; as with the &quot; f@@ lies &quot; - the lesser officials - although just a hand@@ ful of high @-@ ranking officials has been sentenced , including former executives of oil gi@@ ant Petro@@ China .
The most recent high @-@ profile case has been that of the former head of the CCP in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse . Pre@@ viously his si@@ ghts were set on the highest offices in the state .
Nevertheless , the government has not declared any intention of reforming its anti @-@ corruption system , for example by creating a body independent of the Party .
Two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord , Royal Commission h@@ ears
Two Y@@ M@@ CA NS@@ W employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation , &quot; the Commission was told .
Chief executive officer Philli@@ p H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child pornography offences , and another when a gy@@ m instruc@@ tor at the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , counsel assisting the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
He conce@@ ded the Y@@ M@@ CA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claiming &quot; there have been external audits of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recognised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
Evidence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conce@@ ded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches .
Ear@@ lier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
He was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
But Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s breaches of child safety .
Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children , bab@@ y@@ sitting them privately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and let@@ ting them play with his mobile phone .
Dani@@ elle Oc@@ k@@ well , who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testified she found the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah children &apos;s services manager Jac@@ qui Bar@@ n@@ at who supervised Lord &quot; very in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
The CEO said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their managers .
Rather , he said , their friend@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their judgements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA NS@@ W board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jonathan Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children &apos;s services Li@@ am Whit@@ ley .
He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous &quot; and poorly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA NS@@ W was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Sm@@ all@@ bone of Griff@@ ith University told the commission .
He said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , screening , induction , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing adjourn@@ ed until December 20 .
Tony Blair said he &apos;d seize the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowledges a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 @-@ year @-@ old aired his views on various domestic policies .
Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , confin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as en@@ voy to the Quartet of Middle East pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers .
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair was quoted by London &apos;s E@@ ven@@ ing Standard as saying : &quot; Yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
As crow@@ ds of horse @-@ showing experts gathered in Cardi@@ ff to battle it out for Horse of the Year , they knew the competition would be tou@@ gh .
But no@@ body was quite ready for three @-@ year @-@ old F@@ enton Kir@@ kland .
Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the to@@ dd@@ ler and his pet Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y T@@ off@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult op@@ ponents tr@@ ailing behind .
The in@@ separ@@ able pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sun@@ ny@@ bank E@@ ques@@ tri@@ an Centre , in Ru@@ dry near Cardi@@ ff .
Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bo@@ w@@ ler h@@ ats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded two @-@ year @-@ old T@@ off@@ ee around the ring .
F@@ enton was lau@@ ded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
And T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
F@@ enton was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birth@@ day present last March and has practi@@ sed with the Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day since .
His mother Donna , 30 , said : &quot; F@@ enton and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
They were up against all comers but the two of them wal@@ ked off with the gold cu@@ p and ros@@ ette .
It was only the second time he had comp@@ eted with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ static when he won .
Complete str@@ angers in the arena all thought he was so phenomen@@ al they wanted photos taken with him .
The youn@@ g@@ ster , from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ bw V@@ ale , South Wales , is following in the foot@@ steps of his aun@@ t Sharon How@@ ells , who has been showing hor@@ ses for more than 10 years .
Mrs How@@ ells said : &quot; The whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cl@@ apping . &quot;
He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous job .
F@@ enton is animal mad - he lo@@ ves hor@@ ses , trac@@ tors and farms and has got two ch@@ ick@@ ens which he looks after .
The way he has started he &apos;ll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : &quot; F@@ enton is only three but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . &quot;
They are a great team together .
The judges marked F@@ enton and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
They look for good team@@ work between the pon@@ y and the hand@@ ler - F@@ enton and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;m sure F@@ enton was helped by his cu@@ te clothes , he really looked the part .
China plea paper &apos; to be over@@ hau@@ le@@ d&apos;
A Chinese newspaper that made a front @-@ page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation is to be over@@ hau@@ led , a press regulator says .
The Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou @-@ based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Y@@ ong@@ zh@@ ou .
But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabric@@ ate stories about a part state @-@ owned company .
Now the New Express is to undergo &quot; full rectification , &quot; the regulator said .
The &quot; rectification &quot; order came from the Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Administration of Press and Publication , Radio , Film and Television .
A preliminary investigation showed that Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ eng E@@ ven@@ ing News Group &apos;s New Express had published several un@@ true reports about listed company Zo@@ om@@ lion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .
&quot; New Express &apos;s editorial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regulator said in a statement .
It said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Chen Y@@ ong@@ zh@@ ou by revo@@ king his reporter &apos;s license . &quot;
It had also &quot; instructed Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ eng E@@ ven@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction @-@ equipment company called Zo@@ om@@ lion .
After he was detained , his newspaper published two front @-@ page appeals for his release , saying it backed his journ@@ alism .
But Mr Chen then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; In this case I &apos;ve caused damages to Zo@@ om@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broadcas@@ ter CC@@ TV .
I did this mainly because I han@@ k@@ ered after money and f@@ ame .
I &apos;ve re@@ alised my wrong@@ doing .
Following Mr Chen &apos;s apo@@ logy , New Express issued a front @-@ page apo@@ logy , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
Several high @-@ profile suspects have made tele@@ vised conf@@ essions recently .
Experts say conf@@ essions are still routinely co@@ erc@@ ed , despite a change in the law earlier this year b@@ anning the authorities from forcing anyone to incrimin@@ ate themselves .
Charles @-@ de @-@ Gau@@ lle Aircraft Carrier &quot; Un@@ available &quot;
The aircraft carrier has been left high and dry in Tou@@ lon .
A le@@ ak of radioactive steam , detected on one of the two nuclear sto@@ ke@@ holds on the Charles @-@ de @-@ Gau@@ lle in mid @-@ October when the ship was at sea , &quot; posed no threat to the sail@@ ors &quot; , but is no small matter for the Navy .
&quot; La Roy@@ ale &quot; - the French Navy - has just conform@@ ed that the ship will be &quot; un@@ available until mid @-@ November &quot; to allow &quot; time to carry out the corrective measures required &quot; on the re@@ actor .
Specialist naval defence company D@@ CNS has confirmed that its teams , along with A@@ rev@@ a &apos;s , have been dispat@@ ched to the department of V@@ ar and are &quot; currently working on aircraft carrier &quot; .
Their tasks include changing a pump on the fau@@ l@@ ty sto@@ ke@@ hold .
&quot; Every@@ thing has been put in place to enable the Charles @-@ de @-@ Gau@@ lle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013 , &quot; explains D@@ CNS .
And the Navy ass@@ ures that &quot; this has in no way delayed the &#91; nuclear @-@ powered &#93; ship &apos;s activity schedule &quot; .
It should be recalled that the Charles @-@ de @-@ Gau@@ lle had just returned from a six @-@ month period of interim maintenance .
It had cast off from Tou@@ lon in mid @-@ October for a training exercise ,
principally for the qualification of new figh@@ ter pilots .
A &quot; small amount of damage &quot; , confined to the area of the re@@ actor chamber , then occurred on the French fleet &apos;s flag@@ ship .
According to the Navy , the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been notic@@ ing the strong dis@@ satisfaction of people I meet everywhere : the hor@@ rend@@ ous re@@ valuation of their properties , a del@@ u@@ ge of taxes , the costs of all sor@@ ts of permits , end@@ less administrative fees , etc .
In short , the limit@@ less si@@ phon@@ ing of money from our pock@@ ets .
Milli@@ ons of squ@@ an@@ dered dollars could be saved by introducing a tax system that is much more respectful of the taxpayers .
Money for@@ ci@@ bly raised from taxpayers reduces their dispos@@ able income and contributes to their impo@@ ver@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ in@@ igan , despite the closure of every major business , there is no emb@@ arr@@ assment about the ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant expenditure and the maintenance of white el@@ eph@@ ants , such as the un@@ profitable cultural centre , the huge subsidies for the Cité de l &apos;@@ Énergie , etc .
These facilities are not profitable , so they should be sold to private businesses or dem@@ ol@@ ished .
It is also dist@@ ressing to note the compulsory purchase of numerous properties to make way for a major industrial complex which never arrived .
However , I do make hon@@ ourable mention of the transformation of the former W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a sort of industrial incub@@ ator , but at what cost to the taxpayers ?
It is not up to the public pur@@ se to invest in such projects , but to the private sector based on consumer demand .
The tow@@ ns@@ folk have been pleased to learn that Lac à la Pê@@ che and Lac des Pi@@ les will continue to supply the town with potable water .
Following the departure of all the industries ( major consumers of water ) and the big decline in the population , the use of water throughout the district has considerably reduced .
While this does not call for was@@ tage , the town will never be short of water , and the severe regulation of its use may be t@@ oned down significantly .
In a nu@@ t@@ shell , it is easy to do great things with other people &apos;s money .
I would be ash@@ amed to defend such a balance sheet .
With a gross debt of over $ 200 million , this town is no longer even capable of buying a pen without passing a loan b@@ ye @-@ law .
For over 40 years we have been run largely by suits with mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous qualifications . I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do any worse .
US @-@ Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , ventilation and electric rail systems .
US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered .
The tunnel , which z@@ ig@@ z@@ ags the length of nearly six football pit@@ ches , links ware@@ houses near Ti@@ juana , Mexico and San Di@@ ego , USA .
The area is filled with non@@ descrip@@ t ware@@ houses , making it easier to conce@@ al trucks being loaded with drugs .
The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detected , authorities said .
Authorities seized eight @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute .
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted .
In No@@ g@@ ales , Ari@@ z@@ ona , smu@@ ggl@@ ers tap into vast underground drainage can@@ als .
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Di@@ ego since 2006 .
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s marijuana harvest in October , which presents drug car@@ tels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
In 2010 , authorities found a roughly 700 @-@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ juana home to two San Di@@ ego ware@@ houses .
British police serve Ass@@ ange with extradition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an extradition notice today on Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange , who has taken refuge in Ecuador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in London and requested asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said they had served a &quot; surrender notice &quot; on the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ ange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations , having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court over@@ turned his appeal against extradition earlier this month .
F@@ ear@@ ing Stockholm would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at Ecuador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has &quot; served a surrender notice upon a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
He remains in breach of his bail conditions .
The emb@@ ass@@ y declined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ ange fears he will be extrad@@ ited from Sweden to the United States to face possible es@@ pion@@ age charges , after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks anti @-@ secrecy website .
How Bi@@ ome@@ trics Will Inv@@ ade Our Li@@ ves
Is it the end of pass@@ words to access a s@@ mar@@ t@@ phone or pay for purchases ?
US , French and Japanese researchers are predic@@ ting a future where we will be recognised by biom@@ etric sensors on tel@@ eph@@ ones and computers .
Bernard Di@@ dier , vice @-@ president of Mor@@ ph@@ o , believes this will be the &quot; century of biom@@ e@@ trics &quot; .
Bi@@ ome@@ trics will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as trans@@ verse and transnational as the Internet .
Organisations devoted to privacy protection note this fascin@@ ation for biom@@ e@@ trics , but are concerned .
In France alone in 2011 , the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liber@@ ties authorised 7@@ 74 im@@ print recognition systems , for recogn@@ ising finger@@ prints , the shape of the hand or networks of ve@@ ins in the hand , for businesses , institutions , caf@@ e@@ teri@@ as , etc .
&quot; Everyone will soon be identifiable , anywhere and any time , &quot; says a concerned Jus@@ tin Bro@@ ok@@ man , consumer privacy director for the CD@@ T ( Center for Democracy and Technology ) in Washington .
But why such optimis@@ m for some and p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m for others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ trics will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers .
In France today , the most commonly used biom@@ etric data are finger@@ prints , hand ge@@ ome@@ try and the network of ve@@ ins in the pal@@ m or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its limitations .
&quot; For example , people who work with cement have damage to their fin@@ gers that r@@ enders their finger@@ prints un@@ read@@ able , &quot; notes Philippe Robin , technical director for identification at Th@@ ales Communications &amp; Security .
Furthermore , the detection and verification of a network of ve@@ ins or of hand ge@@ ome@@ try require a voluntary and specific ges@@ ture on the part of individuals .
It is both a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an in@@ convenience - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time .
As a consequence , research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods , such as face or i@@ ris recognition ( the coloured part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity of the computers used to analyse this data , these techniques are becoming practical .
The accuracy of face recognition has improved ten@@ fold over the past five years , considers Cy@@ ri@@ lle Bat@@ aller , R &amp; D laboratory director at Ac@@ cent@@ ure in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport g@@ ates that use face recognition .
It is now possible to identify a moving face or i@@ ris .
&quot; Today we are carrying out research into voice and g@@ ait recognition using son@@ ic sensors , but it requires a silent environment , &quot; says S@@ rid@@ h@@ ar Ly@@ eng@@ ar , director of security research at In@@ tel Lab@@ s .
DNA , a unique and un@@ falsi@@ fiable marker , also arou@@ ses hope and concern .
&quot; With the current state of knowledge , it could be considered the ultimate in biom@@ etric data , &quot; confirms Sophi@@ e Vul@@ li@@ et @-@ T@@ aver@@ nier , director of research , innovation and forecasting at the CN@@ IL .
But DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive .
N@@ EC is offering the judicial police a portable pack costing 9@@ 0,000 euros that can analyse DNA samples on a crime scene within an hour .
The uses of biom@@ e@@ trics fall into two groups : identification ( recognition of one person amongst others ) and authentication ( confirmation that a person is who they say they are ) .
Until now , identification has consisted of the provision of identity papers : biom@@ etric systems ( finger@@ prints , photos , i@@ ris , etc . ) will have to be given access to information that the state holds on every citizen already on file .
This will provide assurance that someone is not trying to us@@ ur@@ p the identity of another .
This principle of comparison can be used for other purposes .
N@@ EC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store .
&quot; We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ties that are freely available on the Internet , &quot; explains D@@ any N@@ assi@@ f , business development director for biom@@ etric identification solutions at N@@ EC France .
Another use is to take a photo of someone qu@@ eu@@ ing in a shop , follow his progress using face recognition and work out the waiting time .
Auth@@ entic@@ ation initially concerned physical ( at borders , in protected locations , in a caf@@ e@@ teria etc . ) or digital presence ( logging on to a computer ) .
Ad@@ ded to this , more recently , are presence checks .
&quot; A biom@@ etric time@@ ke@@ eper prevents the situation where one colleague c@@ locks in on behalf of another , &quot; asser@@ ts Cy@@ ri@@ lle Bat@@ aller from Ac@@ cent@@ ure .
But , more and more , authentication will also involve transactions , in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inser@@ ting your card and placing your hand on a biom@@ etric reader : this ges@@ ture replaces the use of a P@@ IN .
A similar technique is being tested at Vill@@ en@@ eu@@ ve @-@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in Ang@@ oul@@ ême by the company Natural Security , in partnership with banks and major retailers : at the point of paying with a card in a shop , the customer does not enter a code - they place a fin@@ ger in a reader , which sc@@ ans the ve@@ ins .
The experiment is expected to last six months .
If it is conclu@@ sive , biom@@ etric readers could soon be seen in shops in France .
W@@ ays to re@@ assure users
There are three ways to make biom@@ e@@ trics appe@@ aling to the general public .
The first is to explain how it can save time .
&quot; If a customer sp@@ ends thirty seconds less at a till thanks to biom@@ e@@ trics , it would be nice , &quot; says the manager of a major store .
The second is to offer person@@ alised services : in a few years a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you custom@@ ised options .
Finally , the public can be re@@ assured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases .
&quot; Digital finger@@ prints are stored in a primary server ; the identities of individuals are in a second database . The correlation between the two sets of information is encryp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which locks up if anyone tries to move it , &quot; specifies Philippe Robin from Th@@ ales .
However , given the lack of in @-@ depth studies , it is impossible to know if this line will really conv@@ ince users .
Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned .
&quot; The advances in face recognition , the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on F@@ ace@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or Pic@@ asa make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance , &quot; predic@@ ts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada .
D@@ river spe@@ eding at 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h with hot drink between legs fined £ 1,000
A motor@@ ist has been fined £ 1,000 for driving at up to 13@@ 0@@ mp@@ h ( 210@@ km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
Andrew How@@ ie , 35 , of Ti@@ p@@ tree , Es@@ sex , was spo@@ t@@ ted driving his Merc@@ e@@ des Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 at Br@@ ain@@ tree on 27 May .
When police stopped him they discovered the tak@@ e@@ away drink between his legs .
At Col@@ chester Mag@@ istr@@ ates &apos; Court How@@ ie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six @-@ month driving ban .
How@@ ie was also ordered to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim surcharge of £ 100 .
Tax on foreign property owners to bur@@ st London &apos;s bu@@ b@@ ble
The Treasury have provisi@@ onally co@@ sted out the CG@@ T measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £ 2@@ m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
Al@@ ready the stamp duty take for residential property in the bo@@ rough@@ s of Westminster and K@@ ens@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea , which stood at £ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yor@@ k@@ shire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr Cook said : &quot; Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti @-@ avoidance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under @-@ taxed irrespective of the effect of the out @-@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; But this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell , &quot; he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the afflu@@ ent south @-@ west London belt , which stret@@ ches from Ful@@ ham to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
Prices in central London continued to show steady year @-@ on @-@ year growth of 5.6 % but were over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.4 % ) and east ( 6.5 % ) all experiencing an up@@ tic@@ k , according to research from Sav@@ ills .
Scienti@@ sts have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mo@@ od .
Ear@@ lier research had revealed that happy dogs w@@ ag their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while ner@@ vous dogs have a left @-@ dominated sw@@ ish .
But now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these sub@@ tle tail differences .
Pro@@ f Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ scienti@@ st from the University of T@@ ren@@ to , said : &quot; It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimul@@ i that invo@@ kes positive or negative emo@@ tions . &quot;
Here we attempted to look at it in other species .
He added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left @-@ handed movement and vice versa , and the two hem@@ isph@@ eres played different roles in emo@@ tions .
To find out more about how dogs react to the lo@@ p @-@ sided tail wag@@ s of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they watch@@ ed films of other dogs .
They measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analysed their behaviour .
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
Pro@@ f V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : &quot; We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a natur@@ alistic version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to get rid of any other conf@@ ounding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
When the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail @-@ w@@ agging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relax@@ ed .
But when they spo@@ t@@ ted a tail ve@@ er predominantly to the left ( again from the tail @-@ sw@@ ishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates pic@@ ked up and they looked anxi@@ ous .
Pro@@ f V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were intenti@@ onally communicating with each other through these movements .
Instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shoul@@ dn &apos;t feel wor@@ ri@@ ed about .
He said : &quot; If you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail w@@ agging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
The researchers say the findings could give owners , vets and trainers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emo@@ tions .
Do@@ g behaviour expert John Brad@@ sh@@ aw , a visiting fellow at the University of Br@@ ist@@ ol &apos;s school of veterinary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada , he said : &quot; Do@@ gs were more likely to approach a robo@@ t dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to w@@ ag left rather than right , rather than becoming anxi@@ ous - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or rob@@ o @-@ dogs as can@@ ines .
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ m@@ ered out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .
Arctic Mon@@ keys postpon@@ e G@@ las@@ go@@ w gi@@ g due to Alex Tur@@ ner &apos;s illness
Rock band the Arctic Mon@@ keys have postponed a gi@@ g in G@@ las@@ go@@ w after their lead sing@@ er was diagnosed with lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis .
The Sh@@ eff@@ ield group were scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday .
However , lead sing@@ er Alex Tur@@ ner &apos;s illness has forced them to res@@ chedule the show .
The band &apos;s announcement came after they were forced to similarly postpon@@ e a gi@@ g at the L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a in Bir@@ min@@ gham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Mon@@ keys said : &quot; Following the decision to postpon@@ e the show at the Bir@@ min@@ gham L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a ton@@ ight and after seeking medical advice , Arctic Mon@@ keys must also postpon@@ e the show at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w Hydro on Friday , November 1 . &quot;

P@@ ope Francis to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
P@@ ope Francis will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the V@@ ati@@ can announced Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the highest @-@ ranking cl@@ ergy in the Catholic Church below the po@@ pe , and they &apos;re the ones who elect pop@@ es , so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
There are now 201 car@@ din@@ als .
However , once a car@@ dinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a po@@ pe -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ dinal electors . &quot;
In a statement announc@@ ing the news , Father Feder@@ ico Lom@@ bar@@ di , a V@@ ati@@ can spo@@ kes@@ man , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consist@@ ory .
&quot; P@@ ope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convo@@ ke February &apos;s consist@@ ory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; Lom@@ bar@@ di said .
Jack Val@@ ero of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of car@@ dinal electors was likely to have dropped .
He said usually a po@@ pe would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ dinal electors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
Next year &apos;s consist@@ ory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
&quot; It will be interesting to see whether the new P@@ ope will nomin@@ ate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
Forty percent of Roman Cath@@ ol@@ ics are in South America , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
The car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .
In the past the P@@ ope decided everything on his own .
&quot; Now Francis has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; Val@@ ero said .
He said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Francis would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
But we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .
Val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elevated b@@ ish@@ ops from large places to the position of car@@ dinal but that Francis was &quot; full of sur@@ prises -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name . &quot;
GM recalls some new p@@ ick@@ up trucks in U.S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs
General Mot@@ ors Co is recalling nearly 19@@ ,000 of its all @-@ new 2014 Chev@@ ro@@ let Sil@@ ver@@ ado and G@@ MC Sierra p@@ ick@@ up trucks to repair a problem with the manual re@@ clin@@ ing se@@ at@@ back , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday .
On some of the trucks , the front seats may have a def@@ ect in the re@@ clin@@ ing mechanism .
As a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restr@@ aints .
&quot; If the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restraint may not properly protect occupants , increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website .
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
GM &apos;s truck roll @-@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring .
GM told truck owners about the def@@ ect in the first half of October .
N@@ HT@@ SA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16 @-@ day government shut@@ down , which temper@@ ed auto sales growth in October .
Sales of the Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra trucks , which were re@@ designed for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , GM said on Friday .
In October , GM sold 4@@ 2,@@ 660 Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16,@@ 503 Sierra p@@ ick@@ up trucks .
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
Wor@@ ker Di@@ es Bur@@ ied Under Con@@ cre@@ te B@@ locks
A construction worker died after being bur@@ ied under do@@ z@@ ens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon .
The tragedy occurred at around 11@@ am on Rue Mar@@ quette , near the junction with Rue Beau@@ bien , in the district of Ro@@ sem@@ ont @-@ La Petite @-@ Patri@@ e .
By all accounts , foundation work had been going on at the site for some time .
A shared foundation wall had just been er@@ ected in the past few days .
The accident occurred just after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools .
&quot; I was going past in my car when I saw the wall collapse , creating a huge cloud of dust , &quot; said Syl@@ vain Jean , who lives near the site .
&quot; I got out and went to remove the large blocks that were covering him .
Only part of his back was visible , it &apos;s really s@@ ad . &quot;
According to the authorities , the victim is a man in his fif@@ ties , who worked for a form@@ work company .
At@@ temp@@ ts at re@@ susc@@ itation were made by the emergency services , but without success .
The man succ@@ umb@@ ed to his serious injuries .
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispat@@ ched to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy .
An Obama voter &apos;s cr@@ y of des@@ pair
I voted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by GO@@ P obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
Ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;t excuse Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website wo@@ es , dr@@ one attacks
Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ oir is a s@@ ad reminder of what might have been
Nath@@ ani@@ el P. Morris is a second @-@ year student at Harvard Medical School .
I &apos;m reading a terri@@ bly s@@ ad book these days .
It &apos;s a book that I thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dr@@ ums of second @-@ year medical school , and renew in me a sense of hope .
It &apos;s called &quot; The Au@@ dac@@ ity to W@@ in , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ oir of Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
When I &apos;m finished with my patient write @-@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your b@@ reat@@ h away .
The election turned out to be a land@@ slide , and news anch@@ ors pau@@ sed to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
My class@@ mates cri@@ ed with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
A young team of visi@@ on@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
And then I close the book .
C@@ ut@@ ting to the present is a ru@@ de aw@@ ak@@ ening , like sn@@ apping out of a dream .
It &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimis@@ m -- they seem a distant memory , a s@@ ad reminder of opportunities gone by .
Change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first ballot .
It was simply nothing I could have imagin@@ ed .
I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments , from the passage of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden .
Moreover , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has u@@ pend@@ ed too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Gu@@ antan@@ am@@ o Bay , among others .
But , after the coun@@ tless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers , I &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide .
I &apos;ve reached a point of political des@@ pair .
Re@@ public@@ an obstruc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gg@@ ing of foreign leaders , nor having dr@@ ones strike innocent children overseas .
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosecu@@ ting wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ b@@ low@@ ers who reveal government wrong@@ doing .
It cannot account for assassin@@ ating An@@ war al @-@ A@@ w@@ l@@ aki , an American citizen , without a trial , nor shir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Ni@@ x@@ on Administration . &quot;
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act was signed into law .
I don &apos;t know if this is what I should have expected .
If , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contr@@ ad@@ ict the political campaigns that prece@@ de it .
Ob@@ viously , el@@ ective office isn &apos;t a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town massacre , will shape our public conversation .
Yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
That is what troubles me most of all .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
Still , as Obama &apos;s approval rating san@@ k below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much har@@ der .
It makes me y@@ earn for the many promises that disappeared .
This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylv@@ ania primary .
At a post @-@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to get our mo@@ jo back , &quot; he said .
We &apos;ve got to remember who we are . &apos; 
It &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t agree with you more .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nath@@ ani@@ el Morris .
A serious accident occurred between a motor@@ bike and a car on Rue Re@@ tin@@ ne in Fl@@ eron at around 3 pm on Friday .
The motor@@ cycl@@ ist , Jonathan , aged 26 , from Fl@@ ér@@ on , was not wearing a hel@@ met .
Despite the quick intervention of the emergency services , he died as a result of the head @-@ on collision .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims PM Tony Abbot@@ t has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme
B@@ illi@@ on@@ aire MP C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister Tony Abbot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his d@@ augh@@ ters might get pregnant and benefit from it .
The mining magn@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to br@@ ush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are ax@@ ed .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbot@@ t &apos;s d@@ augh@@ ters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; He &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those d@@ augh@@ ters get pregnant , he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; Mr Pal@@ mer said .
Two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared Mr Pal@@ mer the winner of the Sun@@ sh@@ ine Coast seat of Fair@@ fax by 53 votes , after a rec@@ ount .
Mr Pal@@ mer called for over@@ haul of election counting to speed up the process .
Tony Abbot@@ t &apos;s d@@ augh@@ ters Fr@@ ances and Bri@@ dg@@ et .
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; We need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
Why is it that we shoul@@ dn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in , pun@@ ch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also critic@@ ised the use of p@@ enc@@ ils to mark ballots .
Is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it ?
In this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordinary .
The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the Sun@@ sh@@ ine Coast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
Public office is about public service .
&quot; We seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
A team of bi@@ ologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new hum@@ p@@ back dol@@ ph@@ in species living off the northern coast of Australia .
Thib@@ aut B@@ ouver@@ oux , in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l &apos;@@ E@@ tude des Anim@@ aux et Mili@@ eux Mar@@ ins ( O@@ CE@@ AM@@ M ) , discussed this discovery with L &apos;@@ Express and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Did the discovery of this new hum@@ p@@ back dol@@ ph@@ in species surprise you ?
It &apos;s good news , but it didn &apos;t surprise me especially .
In the past , species have been described and identified on the basis of morph@@ ology , anat@@ omy and geography . Today , the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the classification of species .
Moreover , there is a possibility that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus , family or even order .
In the early 19th century , morph@@ ologists classified animals on the basis of the morph@@ ological differences between species .
Today , some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics .
Likewise , two species that are very similar in morph@@ ology were distinguished using genetics .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
About a decade ago , scientists recognised two species that belong@@ ed to this sub @-@ family : Pacific hum@@ p@@ back dol@@ ph@@ ins and Atlantic hum@@ p@@ back whales .
Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished .
Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says ?
From the point of view of conservation , it is essential to be aware of genetic differences so a species and , thus , its genetic variability can be protected .
Researchers have known about this population for a long time , but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location .
Hence , in the event of large @-@ scale mortality in the region , caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture , we would know that we are dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much more widespread species .
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered based on the number of its members alive on the planet , known as the stock , and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks .
The stock of the Sou@@ sa Chin@@ ensis species , from which the newly discovered population der@@ ives , has automatically grown weak@@ er , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new marine mam@@ mal species ?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homog@@ eneous , open habitats , in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals .
This bl@@ ending of genes limits the creation of new species .
On the other hand , more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation , which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species .
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments .
We prefer sending robo@@ ts to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mari@@ ana T@@ ren@@ ch , just 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean .
More money is spent on the search for life on other plan@@ ets than on marine research , and it is high time things changed .
RB@@ S susp@@ ends two fore@@ x traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction .
Some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including U@@ BS , Bar@@ cl@@ ays , Deutsche Bank and RB@@ S , have confirmed they are co @-@ operating with regulators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
The two traders would be the first RB@@ S employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echo@@ es the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manipulation scand@@ al .
The bank , which declined to comment on the suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .
&quot; Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co @-@ operating fully with the F@@ CA and our other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
Last month , people close to the situation said that RB@@ S had turned over records of em@@ ails and instant messages to the UK regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority , sent to and from a former trad@@ er .
This trad@@ er , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left RB@@ S in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of fore@@ x spot trading at J@@ PM@@ organ .
Ro@@ han Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of European spot trading at Cit@@ i , went on leave this week , while Mat@@ t Gard@@ iner , a former senior currencies trad@@ er at Bar@@ cl@@ ays and U@@ BS , was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week .
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong@@ doing .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s instant message group included ban@@ kers at Bar@@ cl@@ ays and Citi@@ group , people close to the situation said .
U@@ BS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , Switzerland &apos;s competition authority We@@ ko , the F@@ CA , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that ban@@ kers coll@@ u@@ ded to move the currencies market .
HS@@ BC , Citi@@ group , J@@ PM@@ organ and Credit Suisse have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
Banks are scour@@ ing through years &quot; worth of instant messages and em@@ ails to search for instances of wrong@@ doing .
News about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for spec@@ ul@@ ators .
Some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
A senior trad@@ er said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trad@@ er at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co @-@ operating with its regulators .
&quot; We are confident the trad@@ er acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Suisse said .
Investigation on Mayor Rob Ford Bot@@ ched , Law@@ yer Main@@ tains
After the police confirmed that they laid hands on a copy of a video allegedly showing Rob Ford smoking cr@@ ack , Barr@@ ister Cl@@ ay@@ ton Ru@@ by maintained that he has never seen an investigation &quot; so bot@@ ched &quot; .
The barr@@ ister said to the Canadian Press that he believes the police had &quot; ignored or down@@ played &quot; evidence against the may@@ or .
This Thursday , police arrested Rob Ford &apos;s friend and occasional chauff@@ eur , Alexander Lis@@ i , aged 35 , and charged him with ex@@ tor@@ tion in relation with the video .
Lis@@ i , who has previously been accused of drug trafficking , was frequently in contact with the may@@ or .
The police said they have also observed him delivering par@@ c@@ els to Rob Ford , according to new court documents .
Ru@@ by says it is &quot; in@@ explic@@ able &quot; that the police have never search@@ ed Rob Ford &apos;s vehicle or home , or t@@ apped his telephone , saying that chief of police Bill Blair know@@ ingly decided not to act against the may@@ or .
In accordance with the law , the police , having themselves witnessed suspicious transactions , could have intercep@@ ted Ford &apos;s vehicle , arrested the may@@ or and carried out a search - even without a warrant .
They could also have requested an immediate search warrant , if this was considered necessary .
The chief of police has not commented . However , his spo@@ kes@@ man , Mark Pu@@ g@@ ash , has described Ru@@ by &apos;s statements as &quot; an obvious and des@@ per@@ ate attempt &quot; to sell himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him at all .
In a press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that might constitute a &quot; reasonable mo@@ tive &quot; that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the may@@ or .
European Markets , Except London , Fall in Mid @-@ session
The major European stock markets , except London , are on a down trend in mid @-@ session this Friday . They are being dr@@ agged down by dis@@ appointing news from businesses , while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise .
Also , investors are still t@@ reading with caution , as they believe that the American Federal Reserve might end its quantitative eas@@ ing policy earlier than expected .
On the other hand , following the announcement of a 0.7 % inflation throughout the euro@@ zone , the idea that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) might relax its monetary policy has been spreading amongst actors in the market .
Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that opening price of US shares will rise , following two consecutive sessions marked by a downward trend .
On the securities market , Ren@@ ault ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the greatest drop with the CAC 40 , weigh@@ ed down by the profit warning issued by its partner , N@@ iss@@ an Motor , on Friday .
The Royal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) recorded the worst performance in the Euro@@ Fir@@ st@@ 300 , after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announc@@ ing the creation of an internal bad bank structure covering £ 38 000 million of its highest risk assets .
On its part , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one ( + 2.45 % ) is still leading the upward trend in the Euro@@ Fir@@ st@@ 300 in response to a press release indicating that AT &amp; T was looking at a possible tak@@ e@@ over bid .
On the exchange market , spec@@ ulation regarding a change in the ECB &apos;s monetary policy are ri@@ fe , as testified by John Har@@ dy , a strateg@@ ist at S@@ ax@@ o Bank .
The ECB &apos;s sole mandate has always re@@ vol@@ ved around inflation , therefore Mario Dr@@ ag@@ hi and his team have all the more reason to take action at their meeting next week .
We are forecasting a highly likely drop in the Euro .
In this context , the Euro continues to drop as compared to the US dollar and , during the session , reached a record two @-@ week low at $ 1.@@ 35@@ 17 .
Conver@@ sely , these very spec@@ ulations are bo@@ os@@ ting the bond market in the euro@@ zone .
Supreme Court uph@@ olds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
By a 5 @-@ 4 vote , the justi@@ ces ruled the Patient Protection and Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Jus@@ ti@@ ces S@@ cal@@ ia , Thomas , Al@@ ito and Kennedy dis@@ sent@@ ed .
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medic@@ aid eligibility or else lose all federal Medic@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally coercive .
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
The law was vi@@ gorously opposed by each of the major Re@@ public@@ an presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tive nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Moving Tri@@ bu@@ te to War Veterans in M@@ enton
In the heart of the Tr@@ abu@@ quet c@@ eme@@ tery , civilian , religious and military officials , plus numerous patri@@ otic organisations , paid tribute to all soldiers and victims of every war on Friday afternoon .
F@@ low@@ ers were laid on two of the three military bur@@ ial plots in the c@@ eme@@ tery by Mayor Jean @-@ Claude Gu@@ ib@@ al and various other person@@ alities .
Palestinians and Isra@@ elis Cl@@ ash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during a violent cl@@ ash on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November , following exhau@@ s@@ tion of its fuel reserve , the Energy Authority for the Palestinian encl@@ ave announced .
A local commander of the E@@ zz@@ ed@@ ine al @-@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ ga@@ des , Khal@@ ed Ab@@ ou Bak@@ r , and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas , Rab@@ i@@ eh B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a tank shell during an incur@@ sion by the Israeli army east of Khan Y@@ oun@@ es , in the south of the Gaza Strip , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officers of the Al @-@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ ga@@ des , Mohammed al @-@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mohammed Da@@ ou@@ d , were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian encl@@ ave and Israel .
Att@@ ack on tunnel du@@ g by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli tank and an arm@@ oured bul@@ l@@ do@@ zer made an incur@@ sion a hundred metres or so into the territory before ret@@ re@@ ating .
The confrontation las@@ ted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a statement , a Hamas spo@@ kes@@ person , Sam@@ i Ab@@ ou Z@@ ou@@ h@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &quot; her@@ oes &quot; and stated that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation .
Hamas pr@@ ais@@ ed the &quot; Al @-@ Q@@ ass@@ am her@@ oes who died defending the territory against an incur@@ sion at Khan Y@@ oun@@ es by the Z@@ ion@@ ist occu@@ pi@@ er .
Many en@@ em@@ ies were killed or injured during the operation .
Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be h@@ ell for the occu@@ pi@@ er , &quot; the spo@@ kes@@ person threatened .
The Israeli army , on the other hand , stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel du@@ g into Israeli territory from the Palestinian encl@@ ave , which was discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , was intended for &quot; terrorist activities &quot; .
Hamas has def@@ ended its use of tunnels in the fight against Israel , stating that the aim was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military statement .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the &quot; T@@ s@@ ah@@ al forces &quot; ( the Israeli army ) and injured five soldiers .
Israeli attack in northern Syria
&quot; This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians , &quot; said army spo@@ kes@@ person , Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
Furthermore , Israel attacked a military air@@ base in the northwest of Syria , targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement He@@ zb@@ ollah , satellite channel Al @-@ Arab@@ i@@ ya reported on Thursday 31 October .
A US official confirmed that there had been an &quot; Israeli strike &quot; , but did not give details of the target .
&quot; In the past , the targets have been missiles being transferred to He@@ zb@@ ollah , &quot; he merely added .
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information relating to the attack .
C@@ iting &quot; exclusive sources &quot; that it did not name , the Saudi @-@ owned channel stated that &quot; the bomb@@ ing targeted a shipment of ground @-@ to @-@ air missiles intended for He@@ zb@@ ollah in Lebanon , &quot; referring to the powerful Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement that is fighting the reb@@ els alongside the Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , reported several explosions being heard at d@@ awn on Wednesday in a defence air@@ base at Son@@ ar J@@ able , near L@@ atta@@ quie , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation , which relies on a network of militants and medical sources , was unable to identify the origin of the explosions .
It &apos;s a com@@ e@@ back in black and white for Marie Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who is st@@ aging &quot; A Dan@@ se Dan@@ se &quot; , her two new group cho@@ re@@ ographies : the first inspired by the ink drawings and po@@ ems of Henri Mich@@ aux , the second inspired by the famous piano s@@ olo@@ s of Gy@@ mn@@ op@@ é@@ dies de S@@ atie .
This is an evening that show@@ cases Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard &apos;s entire spectrum , from art to man@@ ner@@ is@@ ms and from the black@@ ness of ink to wh@@ it@@ eness .
The background is a white screen .
On the car@@ pet , which is also white , in the immense space of the Théâtre M@@ ais@@ onn@@ eu@@ ve , a body appears , in profile , as thin as a line and dress@@ ed in black .
An Henri Mich@@ aux ink drawing is projected onto the screen .
The body , a simple stroke , takes its shape .
And this shape is definitive of the entire piece : it is a series of physical representations of drawings .
The d@@ anc@@ ers , all dress@@ ed in black , with only their hands and faces un@@ covered , wait on each side of the stage ; they h@@ urr@@ y on when the next graphic appears , incar@@ n@@ ate it , then run off again .
This Henri Mich@@ aux play with black and white is performed as a series of s@@ olo@@ s , in a group in un@@ ison ( a mass acting as a solo ) , a large group of twelve s@@ olo@@ s , in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign .
It is re@@ minis@@ cent of &quot; G@@ lo@@ ire du matin &quot; , where@@ in , in the form of s@@ olo@@ s , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard delivers a series of cho@@ re@@ ographic tasks drawn on car@@ tels and lined up at the front of the stage .
It is the same principle in a gi@@ ant Power@@ Point version .
In this performance , the music is lou@@ d , accompanied by per@@ cus@@ sion and electric guit@@ ars .
The energy is great , and the rhy@@ th@@ m fast .
There is a break when Carol Pri@@ eur takes refuge under the dance mat , micro@@ phone in hand , to deliver , with no so@@ bri@@ ety or reserve , part of a Mich@@ aux po@@ em , in the flat mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous voice of an auction , then continues to dance .
The music starts again , and the sequence continues .
This sustained ( if that is possible ) discharge of sound and energy ends up being de@@ af@@ ening and num@@ bing ,
as does the regul@@ arity of the visual rhy@@ th@@ m .
There are several beautiful fl@@ ashes - the creation of images has always been one of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard &apos;s strong points - like the hair that is ru@@ ff@@ led or the black fabric that extends the lines .
But the cho@@ re@@ ographic approach lacks composition .
One gets the impression that , instead of going in search of Mich@@ aux &apos;s work , the cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ her has imposed herself on it with using her man@@ ner@@ is@@ ms .
The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings .
The Mich@@ aux inks , like G@@ est@@ alt shapes , provide a level of imagination broader and rich@@ er than dance , more po@@ rous .
Only at the end , which is in negative , with the d@@ anc@@ ers broken up a stro@@ be lights and becoming white symbols in a sud@@ den@@ ly dark theatre , does it touch on mag@@ ic .
The audience liked it , the reception was warm .
After the interval , the Gy@@ mn@@ op@@ é@@ dies is rich@@ er .
The stage is partly drap@@ ed in grey , the d@@ anc@@ ers and a piano are covered in fabric , like furniture in an abandoned house .
At the piano , d@@ anc@@ ers take turns to play the scores .
Their touch@@ ing musical aw@@ kw@@ ard@@ ness shows real frag@@ ility .
Cou@@ ples cross the stage as pairs of lo@@ vers , very sen@@ su@@ al , even ero@@ tic .
Group work , small transi@@ ting s@@ olo@@ s , moving as a group , a ch@@ orus , makes the depic@@ tion less bin@@ ary .
C@@ low@@ ns appear , another regular feature of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard &apos;s work , wearing red no@@ ses , in very pol@@ ar@@ ised par@@ ades of male / female lo@@ vers .
Their lo@@ ves are to@@ oth@@ y , ev@@ asive or play@@ ful .
The body movements , the l@@ aughter , the small cri@@ es beauti@@ fully translate the ar@@ cha@@ ic@@ ness , the gr@@ ace@@ fulness and the ab@@ sur@@ d@@ ity of bodies in co@@ itus , of beings mel@@ ting into each other .
But the piece really takes off after the bow .
A c@@ low@@ n comes back on stage as the audience is leaving .
At that point , anything goes : the fourth wall comes down , the explored univer@@ ses are super@@ imposed , the d@@ anc@@ ers ham it up , come down among the spec@@ tat@@ ors , talk , smoke , pass through , play with the eti@@ quette of appl@@ ause , build up the hy@@ pe am@@ id a consci@@ ously calculated disorder that remains sen@@ su@@ al .
They exu@@ de joy and mad@@ ness , and that is Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard &apos;s art ; contamin@@ ating the audience .
Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed over Nor@@ tel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents filed a barrage of patent law@@ suits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ tel bankruptcy auction .
Rock@@ star , the consortium that bought the Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.5 billion , su@@ ed Sam@@ sun@@ g Electron@@ ics Co Ltd , H@@ TC Corp , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rock@@ star is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , Black@@ berry , Er@@ ic@@ sson and Sony .
Google is accused of infr@@ inging seven patents .
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising , the law@@ suit said , which is the core of Google &apos;s search business .
Representatives for Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ TC and Rock@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and H@@ TC all manufacture phones that operate on Google &apos;s An@@ dro@@ id operating system , which compet@@ es fi@@ erc@@ ely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
In 2011 Google placed an initial $ 900 million bid for Nor@@ tel &apos;s patents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.4 billion .
After losing out to Rock@@ star on the Nor@@ tel patents , Google went on to acquire Mot@@ oro@@ la Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal driven partly by Mot@@ oro@@ la &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents @-@ in @-@ suit at auction , Google has infring@@ ed and continues to infr@@ inge , &quot; the law@@ suit said .
Rock@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google &apos;s patent infringement is will@@ ful , according to the complaint .
Ges@@ ves : F@@ aul@@ ty Water He@@ ater C@@ auses Explo@@ sion of House
The grand@@ mother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas le@@ ak ,
leading to an explosion in a house in Ges@@ ves that left two people seriously injured on Friday morning - the 52 @-@ year @-@ old grand@@ mother and her 5 @-@ year @-@ old grand@@ son . The explosion was caused by a gas le@@ ak in a fau@@ l@@ ty water he@@ ater , the assistant public prosecutor said on Friday evening .
The expert , who was dispat@@ ched to the scene by the public prosecutor &apos;s office , stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental .
The grand@@ mother lit a cigarette when there was a gas le@@ ak and a build @-@ up of gas .
The condition of the two victims remains critical .
The grand@@ mother was thro@@ wn across the room by the explosion and seriously bur@@ nt .
The little boy , who was staying with his grand@@ father and partner , was by her side and suffered less serious bur@@ ns .
&quot; The two victims were intu@@ b@@ ated and treated for some time at the site , before being taken to the CH@@ U in Li@@ ège , by helicopter and by ambul@@ ance for the grand@@ mother and her grand@@ son respectively , &quot; said Mayor José Pau@@ let on visiting the site .
The trau@@ mati@@ sed grand@@ father was up@@ stairs at the time of the explosion .
He was un@@ hur@@ t and , thus , able to go down@@ stairs using the st@@ air@@ case which had remained intact , though the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed .
The grand@@ father and the tenant of the house next door , which was weak@@ ened by the explosion , have been accommodated elsewhere by the head of the social services .
The And@@ enne and Nam@@ ur fire departments and the police from Ar@@ ches interven@@ ed .
The Cris@@ née civil protection services has stabil@@ ised the two buildings .
Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Mohamed Mor@@ si takes the o@@ ath of office but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egypt .
ISL@@ AM@@ IST Mohamed Mor@@ si promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the o@@ ath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succe@@ eding Ho@@ s@@ ni M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago .
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Mor@@ si also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islam@@ ist president and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
He took the o@@ ath before the court &apos;s 18 black @-@ rob@@ ed judges in its Nile @-@ side seat built to res@@ emble an ancient Egyptian temp@@ le .
&quot; We asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , &quot; Mor@@ si said during a solem@@ n ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Mor@@ si , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old US @-@ trained engineer from the Muslim Bro@@ therhood , a fundament@@ alist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an out@@ law@@ ed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targeted by successive governments .
Hun@@ dreds of soldiers and polic@@ emen guar@@ ded the building as Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ cade .
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presidential pom@@ p of the M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak years , traffic was only briefly hal@@ ted to allow his motor@@ cade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern sub@@ urb@@ s .
Der@@ ided as the Bro@@ therhood &apos;s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic &quot; spare tyre , &quot; his personal prestige has surg@@ ed since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 u@@ pris@@ ing against the author@@ itarian M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak .
&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Mor@@ si , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the wood @-@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the o@@ ath of office .
Mor@@ si later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address .
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention .
Military rul@@ er Field Mar@@ sh@@ al Hussein T@@ ant@@ awi was in attendance .
His arrival was gre@@ eted with chants of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lecture room .
Established in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education , Cairo University later became a str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of Islam@@ ist student groups in the 1970s .
Mor@@ si took a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on Friday in T@@ ah@@ rir Square , birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that ended M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak &apos;s author@@ itarian rule last year , and vo@@ w@@ ed to re@@ claim presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ou@@ sted leader .
But by agreeing to take the official o@@ ath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is bo@@ wing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
Mor@@ si &apos;s speech in T@@ ah@@ rir Square was filled with dramatic popul@@ ist g@@ est@@ ures .
The shut@@ down in the USA has slow@@ ed down the automotive market .
According to figures published on Friday by manufacturers , five of the top six of which have recorded results below expectations , the 16 @-@ day shut@@ down of most federal administration services sup@@ pressed growth in car sales in the USA in October .
The three major manufacturers in Detroit re@@ alised double @-@ digit growth as compared to October 2012 , but only General Mot@@ ors performed better than expected .
Analy@@ sts had forecast average sales of 15.@@ 4 million units ( annu@@ alised rate , adjusted with seasonal variations ) , but the market settled at 15.@@ 3 million , according to estimates by Adam Jon@@ as , an analy@@ st at Morgan Stanley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s clients , he states that this slight slow @-@ down can principally be explained by &quot; the government shut@@ down and its impact on consumers &apos; feelings in the first half of the month . &quot;
Nevertheless , GM has reported an increase of about 16 % in sales last month with 22@@ 6,@@ 402 vehicles , as compared to 2@@ 11,@@ 5@@ 63 expected by consensus .
The four brands of the group saw an improvement in their commercial performance over October 2012 .
Ford , which is still re@@ ap@@ ing benefits from the success of its pick @-@ up trucks amongst other things , saw sales increase by 14 % over a year to 19@@ 1,9@@ 85 vehicles , against an expectation of 19@@ 4,@@ 301 .
On its part , Chry@@ sl@@ er , which is controlled by Fi@@ at , announced an 11 % increase in sales with 14@@ 0,0@@ 83 vehicles , against an expected 14@@ 3,@@ 5@@ 36 .
Toy@@ ota and N@@ iss@@ an also reported sales below expectations , despite increases of 8.8 % and 1@@ 4.2 % respectively over a year .
On the New York Stock Exchange , GM shares gained 1.4 % at 16 : 35 G@@ MT , while Ford lost 1.1 % .
Ren@@ ault Share Price Pl@@ um@@ mets Following N@@ iss@@ an Warning
Ren@@ ault recorded the biggest drop on the SB@@ F 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner , N@@ iss@@ an Mot@@ ors , announced that it had reduced its net annual profit forecast by almost 20 % , traders report .
N@@ iss@@ an , which was forced to make the revision , also announced a management restructuring .
Several traders reported that Ren@@ ault shares had been affected by the warning this morning .
&quot; It &apos;s clearly because of the N@@ iss@@ an profit warning , &quot; said a trading representative from a Paris broker .
Under the Ren@@ ault @-@ N@@ iss@@ an alliance , Ren@@ ault holds 4@@ 3.4 % of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of the French company &apos;s , according to data on the N@@ iss@@ an website .
Greece : Two De@@ ad in Sho@@ oting Near Ne@@ o @-@ N@@ azi Party Office
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday evening by gun@@ sh@@ ots fired by two people on a motor@@ bike that was passing an office used by ne@@ o @-@ N@@ azi party , Golden Daw@@ n , in the western sub@@ urb@@ s of Athens , a police source has said .
The police are currently unable to give any information on the identity of the victims or any political affili@@ ations they had .
According to reports from some Greek media , members of Golden Daw@@ n said the victims were guar@@ ding the party &apos;s premises .
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital , the same source said .
Anti @-@ terrorist service police r@@ ush@@ ed to the main avenue in the sub@@ ur@@ b of Ne@@ o Ira@@ k@@ lio , where the incident took place , and sealed off the area .
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Daw@@ n members , including the leader and founder of the party , were charged with being part of a &quot; criminal organisation &quot; , within the framework of an operation aimed at the party following the murder of an anti @-@ fas@@ c@@ ist mus@@ ician by one of its members .
Scott Brown Appeal Re@@ jected
Scott Brown , G@@ las@@ go@@ w Cel@@ tic cap@@ tain , has had his appeal rejected and will miss his club &apos;s next two Champ@@ ion &apos;s League matches , against Aj@@ ax and AC Milan .
The Scotland mid@@ fi@@ el@@ der was sent off for a fou@@ l against Ne@@ y@@ mar in the match against FC Barcelona . U@@ EFA has now extended his suspension to three matches .
In a press release , the club said it was &quot; very dis@@ appointed &quot; and that the appeal was entirely justified .
Close to 50,000 homes throughout the province were left without power shortly after mid@@ day on Friday , due to violent winds h@@ itting numerous regions along the St Lawrence River .
The sectors worst affected are the Laurenti@@ des , Mon@@ té@@ régie , and Outaouais , with 15,@@ 0@@ 42 , 13,@@ 4@@ 64 and 8,@@ 6@@ 42 customers respectively pl@@ un@@ ged into dar@@ k@@ ness .
The metro@@ politan region of Montreal is also experiencing its share of break@@ dow@@ ns , with close to 7,000 homes in the city and in Laval left without power .
Th@@ ought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
Flight Centre seem to be bu@@ c@@ king the trend .
The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holi@@ day@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 325 million and $ 340 million , compared with the $ 305 million to $ 315 million it previously forecast .
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
Managing director Graham Tur@@ ner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non @-@ business travel .
&quot; Year @-@ to @-@ date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full @-@ year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators .
In Australia the leisure business reb@@ ounded during the second half which offset a slightly weak@@ er domestic corporate travel market .
Similarly in the UK , Flight Centre &apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
Its US business had recovered its losses during its seas@@ onally weak@@ er first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit .
Flight Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
Unknown Persons Open Fire on Hotel Near Py@@ ram@@ ids in Cairo
Unknown persons wearing hoods opened fire on a hotel close to the pyram@@ ids in Cairo , Egypt this Friday . Nob@@ ody was hur@@ t in the incident which apparently resulted from an argument involving workers who had been made red@@ undant .
The att@@ ack@@ ers fl@@ ed , according to the spo@@ kes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , Police General Ab@@ del L@@ atif .
The attack took place at a time when Egypt is hardly receiving any tourists since the army depos@@ ed the Islamic President , Mohamed Mor@@ si , in early July and bloo@@ di@@ ly sup@@ presses demonstrations by his supporters .
Schools urged to focus more on ma@@ ths , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Sh@@ akes@@ pe@@ are play , a 19th century novel , Rom@@ anti@@ c po@@ etry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards .
The exam will also feature &quot; un@@ seen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
A combined English literature and language course will be sc@@ rapp@@ ed .
From 2015 , pupils will be required to take a stand@@ alone G@@ C@@ SE in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
The Department for Education is due to release the new sy@@ ll@@ abuses in English and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical over@@ haul .
It will make changes in other core subjects next year .
In a separate move , Of@@ qu@@ al , the exam@@ s regulator , will un@@ ve@@ il a sh@@ ake @-@ up of the structure of G@@ C@@ SE@@ s , with a new grading system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
Speaking in the summer , Michael Go@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; ins@@ isting G@@ C@@ SE@@ s would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;
Studies show that English schools devote less time to ma@@ ths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
By comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore .
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to ma@@ ths , Coalition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ C@@ SE - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in le@@ ague tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
The sy@@ ll@@ abus will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathem@@ atics .
This judgement means that it will be possible to enforce a law which was adopted in this state in July and widely brings the issue of the right to abortion into question .

Former G@@ est@@ ap@@ o Chief Bur@@ ied in Jewish C@@ eme@@ tery
Hein@@ rich Mul@@ ler , who was never found after dis@@ appearing at the end of the Second World War , was actually bur@@ ied in a common grave in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Berlin , the head of the German Resistance Memorial , Professor Johann@@ es Tu@@ ch@@ el , confirmed to Bil@@ d .
Mul@@ ler did not survive the war .
&quot; His body was bur@@ ied in a common grave in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Berlin Mit@@ te in 1945 , &quot; he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper , bas@@ ing his statement on archives .
This re@@ vel@@ ation comes 68 years after the fall of Adol@@ f Hit@@ ler &apos;s N@@ azi regime and sol@@ ves one of the big post @-@ War myster@@ ies .
The German Sec@@ ret Service , the B@@ ND , declared in summer 1949 that Mul@@ ler was in Kar@@ lov@@ y V@@ ary , then in Cz@@ echo@@ slov@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
But the secret services were completely wrong .
&quot; Mul@@ ler &apos;s body was found in August 1945 by a command@@ o in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Re@@ ich , &quot; says Mr. Tu@@ ch@@ el .
He was wearing &quot; a general &apos;s uniform &quot; .
&quot; His service papers and photo , amongst other things , were found in the inside left pock@@ et , &quot; he continued .
Bil@@ d also published a document from the borough hall of the Mit@@ te district in Berlin , indicating that he had been bur@@ ied in the district &apos;s Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery .
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , Di@@ eter Gr@@ au@@ mann , said he was sh@@ oc@@ ked by the re@@ vel@@ ation .
Finding that one of the most bru@@ tal N@@ azi s@@ ad@@ ists was bur@@ ied in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery is an ab@@ hor@@ rent enor@@ m@@ ity , he said .
&quot; The memory of the victims is being tr@@ ampl@@ ed under@@ foot in the worst manner , &quot; he said dis@@ gu@@ st@@ edly in the paper .
Hein@@ rich Mul@@ ler was one of the major figures in the Third Re@@ ich never to be captured .
He took part in the W@@ ann@@ see Conference in January 1942 , where the &quot; final solution &quot; was decided upon , and notably was in command of Adol@@ f E@@ ich@@ mann , who was responsible for the &quot; logistics &quot; of the ex@@ termination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .

Tre@@ k@@ king through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ gle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon
B@@ w@@ elle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There aren &apos;t many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,000 people
C@@ ast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle is one of the top 10 CN@@ N Her@@ oes of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Her@@ oes , to be CN@@ N Her@@ o of the Year .
That person will receive $ 250,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Georges B@@ w@@ elle watch@@ ed his ill father slip in and out of consci@@ ousness , trav@@ eling to hospitals that wer@@ en &apos;t equipped to help him .
Jam@@ ef B@@ w@@ elle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Ya@@ oun@@ de , Cameroon &apos;s capital .
He suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ at@@ oma that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; There were no neuro@@ sur@@ geons in Cameroon , &quot; Georges B@@ w@@ elle said .
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money .
Instead , B@@ w@@ elle spent years escor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clinics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; B@@ w@@ elle said .
You can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
Some people can die because they are waiting .
The situation has@@ n &apos;t changed much since B@@ w@@ elle &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
For comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people .
And even if they could see a physician , many Camero@@ oni@@ ans cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t afford it .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three @-@ quarters of the country &apos;s health @-@ care spending is private .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; B@@ w@@ elle said .
And with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
Se@@ eing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer , B@@ w@@ elle was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surg@@ eries in the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a vascular sur@@ geon in Ya@@ oun@@ de &apos;s Central Hospital .
And he started a non@@ profit , AS@@ CO@@ VI@@ ME , that trav@@ els into rural areas on week@@ ends to provide free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 3@@ 2,000 people .
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , tie medical supplies to the ro@@ o@@ fs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .
Their luc@@ k doesn &apos;t always hold out .
They &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d more than once .
But when they arrive , they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome : a fe@@ ast , sing@@ ing and d@@ ancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer .
In these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ w@@ elle -- with his big s@@ mile and bound@@ less energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
The next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; We are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; B@@ w@@ elle said .
They are coming from 60 kilome@@ ters around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care .
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
Others might receive cru@@ t@@ ches , a pair of donated ey@@ e@@ gl@@ asses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many impo@@ ver@@ ished families simply can &apos;t afford .
In the even@@ ings , the team will do simple surg@@ eries with local an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
Operations are usually done in a school@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
With the group &apos;s gener@@ ator lighting the operating room and san@@ iti@@ zing equipment , B@@ w@@ elle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
It &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village mus@@ icians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; They are be@@ ating dr@@ ums all night to keep us aw@@ ake and continue our work , &quot; B@@ w@@ elle said .
On Sunday , the team heads back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of their work .
The group -- a mix of Camero@@ onian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surg@@ eries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
One man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; This will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital sur@@ geon , B@@ w@@ elle also works nights at private medical clinics around Ya@@ oun@@ de .
It &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I &apos;m not sure when he sle@@ eps , &quot; said K@@ atie O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a second @-@ year medical student from Dre@@ x@@ el University in Phil@@ adel@@ ph@@ ia and volunteer with B@@ w@@ elle &apos;s group .
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
For medical and nursing students such as O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ w@@ elle on his missions , it &apos;s a hands @-@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .
&quot; We &apos;ve been able to scru@@ b in on surg@@ eries where we help blo@@ t blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ w@@ elle , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
That &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in America as a second @-@ year medical student .
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon , often arriving with donated medical supplies .
But once they arrive in Ya@@ oun@@ de , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ w@@ elle .
&quot; He &apos;s a her@@ o , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
He gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cameroon people is e@@ ver@@ lasting .
For B@@ w@@ elle , the near @-@ constant workload isn &apos;t a hardship .
Hel@@ ping others live happ@@ ier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; B@@ w@@ elle said .
And I think about my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
To make people lau@@ gh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why I &apos;m doing this .

Pierre Nor@@ a &apos;s Two Fr@@ ances
Per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed by his work , academics have long stru@@ ggl@@ ed to define and place Pierre Nor@@ a .
Is he a professor in lecture h@@ alls and class@@ rooms ?
Of course , but with emphasis on his fond@@ ness for by@@ roads , at Sciences @-@ P@@ o ( French Institute of Political Sciences ) , and Hau@@ tes E@@ tudes ( School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences ) .
Does he play an arb@@ iter of the work of others from his office in Rue Gas@@ ton @-@ G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d ?
Yes , but while ign@@ oring his lesser known work and underground writing as an editor .
Is he the he@@ ir to Fon@@ ten@@ elle &apos;s chair at the Académie Franç@@ aise ?
Yes again , but he knows that such an honour cannot replace the real hol@@ y oil , the philosoph@@ ical work , which he has fo@@ reg@@ one .
They have gl@@ ad@@ ly acknowledged him as a great aw@@ ak@@ ener , a driving force , a uni@@ fier of their work , but observed that he seemed dis@@ inclin@@ ed to produce such work himself .
The mon@@ um@@ ental &quot; Li@@ eux de mémoire &quot; ( places of memory ) , to which his name is attached , has also contributed to this unclear image .
Scand@@ al @-@ mon@@ gers have regarded this work as a gi@@ gan@@ tic &quot; fle@@ a market &quot; , presented by an intelligent and very learned comment@@ ator with a keen eye , but who is an inc@@ urable &quot; d@@ ab@@ bler &quot; .
The two works published by Nor@@ a almost two years ago have already proven that though he appeared not to write , he had written - pl@@ enti@@ fully and well .
This book should defin@@ iti@@ vely do him justice .
However , once again , there is a tendency towards u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , intellectual ro@@ aming , ju@@ bil@@ ation in jum@@ ping , as if with both feet tied , from one subject to another .
Nevertheless , one quickly understands that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered together in this beauti@@ fully ti@@ tled book lead the &quot; second @-@ hand goods dealer &quot; to a constant passion , that of dis@@ covering the core that makes up the French identity .
Why these dramatic appeals for national unity ?
Identity is a contemporary pre@@ occupation .
Not long ago , we were asked to collectively define it .
But , in the per@@ emp@@ tory minds of our former leaders , French identity was a tim@@ eless essence .
All it took was to highlight its mistakes and , in keeping with Jac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism , the issue would be entrusted to pre@@ f@@ ects and sub @-@ pre@@ f@@ ects - the authorised interpreters .
What Pierre Nor@@ a is searching for is something else .
He does not position himself as an he@@ ir to an e@@ ternal Fren@@ ch@@ ness ; he re@@ jects the definition .
As an analy@@ st anxi@@ ous about a familiar str@@ ang@@ eness , he w@@ and@@ ers in a forest of symbols , stops after each step to examine an object in the form of a pu@@ zz@@ le , tor@@ ment@@ ed by irrit@@ ating questions ,
such as this , which arises from the undertaking itself : why , in a country so permanently established within its fron@@ tiers , with such an ancient structure and that is so solid@@ ly built , do we hear these dramatic calls for unity ?
The calls are pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by dis@@ cord in French history , says Nor@@ a .
Fran@@ ks and Gau@@ ls , Ar@@ magn@@ ac@@ s and B@@ urg@@ un@@ di@@ ans , Cath@@ ol@@ ics and Prot@@ est@@ ants : the forces of division in this country are very ancient .
And the most embl@@ ematic is clearly that which split national history in two :
since the uph@@ e@@ aval of the Revolution , the French have had two hist@@ ories and two nations - one mon@@ arch@@ ic , the other rev@@ olutionary .
The second tried to kill off the first , but failed to wi@@ pe it out ; on the contrary , it was w@@ ary of let@@ ting it re@@ discover its sac@@ red@@ ness and was so e@@ ager for unity and indi@@ visibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful incar@@ nation of the two .
And from there was born an inv@@ in@@ ci@@ bly bi@@ partite nation , split into left and right , lay and Catholic , ad@@ oration and hatred for the Revolution .
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity , there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of metro@@ politan France , so much so that Pierre Nor@@ a &apos;s American venture could be the heart of his book .
This is because America and France have both had a revolution , drawn up a declaration of rights , and tried to found a new society .
However , our famili@@ arity with America only emphas@@ ises even more something that is particular to us .
Over there , people abandoned their former rul@@ ers in England and did not have to b@@ other about them any more .
Here , people were bo@@ ther@@ ed by a native old power , and were all the more radical for it .
Over there , the revolution was consensu@@ al , whereas here it engend@@ ered tragedy and conflict .
There , the founding fathers are still honoured , but here , our rev@@ olutionary anc@@ estors are hardly used as role models , bes@@ ides , they killed each other .
There , there has been institutional consistency ; here there has been a tor@@ rent of constitu@@ tions , so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat :
the France on the way out , the France in the making .
However , there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the cur@@ se of the number two .
Pierre Nor@@ a has shown has shown great interest and even tend@@ er@@ ness for this Third Republic : he sal@@ utes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that ob@@ s@@ cu@@ rely pav@@ ed the way for the modern France , and by offering them a unified version of their history .
Yet , this paci@@ fied identity has had its day .
Here we are in debate once again , sh@@ ak@@ en by a new type of immigration , threatened by the inf@@ low of prot@@ esting minorities , absorbed into the European framework .
The book thus offers both a fascin@@ ating portrait of the France on the way out , and a circum@@ sp@@ ect outline of the France in the making .
And , on top of that , there is the portrait of the histori@@ an , which should hold some sur@@ prises .
It reveals that the wan@@ der@@ er liked to stay at home .
The man of many cur@@ io@@ sities is - slightly ob@@ s@@ essi@@ vely - focused on a single idea .
The one who pro@@ w@@ led at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre .
And the man who rejected a notion of a nation over half a century ago , but who escap@@ ed from the initi@@ atory exercise of the philosoph@@ ical work , confi@@ des in us , cu@@ m gran@@ o sal@@ is , that he has ended up doing it after all .
And so he has , but in a less formal , and more explo@@ ded and sub@@ tle form .
A form , which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive ,
because , over and above the format imposed in the university course , this philosoph@@ ical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life .
Former Ho@@ stage in Lebanon S@@ ays &quot; Com@@ ing Back is Difficul@@ t to Hand@@ le &quot;
Journ@@ alist Jean @-@ Louis Nor@@ mand@@ in was kidn@@ apped on 08 March 1986 , along with three members of his An@@ ten@@ ne 2 team who had come to film a He@@ zb@@ ollah demonstration , and was set free almost 21 months later , on 27 November 1987 .
He retired in 2008 , but in 2004 he helped set up a ho@@ stage defence association , &quot; Ot@@ ages du Monde &quot; ( &quot; Ho@@ stages of the World &quot; ) , which he has been running for several years .
The main objective of the association is to make it possible for ho@@ stages to press charges and bring their kid@@ nap@@ pers before the International Criminal Court .
Four A@@ Q@@ MI ( Al @-@ Q@@ a@@ eda in the Islamic Mag@@ hre@@ b ) ho@@ stages , Daniel L@@ arri@@ be , Th@@ ier@@ ry D@@ ol , Pierre Le@@ grand and Marc Fer@@ et , were fre@@ ed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days .
Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val @-@ de @-@ Grâce on Wednesday afternoon , they have now been re@@ united with their families .
Now they can gradually try to resume their lives .
&quot; Le Nouvel Observateur &quot; interviewed 62 @-@ year @-@ old Jean @-@ Louis Nor@@ mand@@ in , a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association &quot; Ot@@ ages du Monde &quot; .
On the evening you were set free , you appeared on the mid @-@ evening news on An@@ ten@@ ne 2 .
What are your mem@@ ories of being set free today ?
On the ground specifically , in Beir@@ ut ?
The day I was set free , I was in the bo@@ ot of a car where I met Roger Au@@ que - although I cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t see him as it was dark .
He said &quot; We &apos;re free , &quot; but I was@@ n &apos;t sure and thought we might still be killed .
We were very exc@@ ited , but also very ten@@ se .
It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very ten@@ se .
They dropped us off on a pav@@ ement .
There were Syrian soldiers there .
We were then taken to the Hotel Summer@@ land where the press had gathered .
Some Fren@@ ch@@ men took us to the French Embassy .
That was when I made my first call to my parents , my family , my friends , the press and so on .
I remember taking a one @-@ hour bath ,
and having dinner in a T @-@ shir@@ t at the French Embassy .
I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
It was still ten@@ se as there was no way of ev@@ acu@@ ating us to Lar@@ n@@ aca airport in Cyprus .
We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ enz@@ ara , where Pas@@ qua got on board .
How were you received when you got to French soil ?
We landed at Or@@ ly .
Chi@@ ra@@ c , the Prime Minister , was there .
It was a bit rough ,
the jo@@ st@@ ling was un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able .
And there was a lot of media .
When I left the country , there were three television channels -
when I got back there were loads of them .
Com@@ ing down the steps of the aero@@ plane , being re@@ united with my son and parents , my friends , that was all very emotional .
Numerous motor@@ bi@@ kes followed our car , which was driven by R@@ ous@@ sin , from the airport to my home .
The bi@@ kes were jo@@ st@@ ling to get in front and take photos . They followed me all the way home , where I had to do some policing to stop some of them clim@@ bing up .
The media pressure was huge .
It w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t stop and we were well placed to know that ...
Yet , the level of emo@@ tion and fatigue made it difficult to think clearly .
You come out of a hole and are sud@@ den@@ ly in the spo@@ t@@ light of the media .
It &apos;s a bit complicated , a bit of a shock , quite difficult to handle .
But we &apos;d been through the hard@@ est part .
I was on the mid @-@ evening news that same evening , and on TV the following day as well .
Then a very gent@@ le sort of read@@ just@@ ment to life started , lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday .
How did the medical examinations and the de@@ briefing with the DG@@ SE ( Directorate General for External Security ) go ?
I had to undergo an initial medical check in C@@ ors@@ ica .
The other tests were carried out in Val @-@ de @-@ Grâce in the days after my return : X @-@ r@@ ays , examinations of every type , and an appointment with a psychi@@ atr@@ ist .
Every@@ thing can &apos;t be sor@@ ted out in one appointment , but you know you can count on the psychi@@ atr@@ ist , call on him if needed , that you have not been abandoned to yourself .
It is all part of the process .
I also met with the intelligence services .
They asked me a lot of questions about the ho@@ stage @-@ tak@@ ers .
It was normal .
It didn &apos;t b@@ other me .
How do you react today to the liber@@ ation of the four ho@@ stages in Niger ?
I &apos;m listening to what &apos;s being said .
Especially the debate about r@@ ans@@ oms .
Some things an@@ no@@ y me , others less so .
I try to distinguish between the questions about my past as a ho@@ stage and my role as president of the association &quot; Ot@@ ages du Monde &quot; , which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with .
For example , I think about the definition of resili@@ ence .
And , I fight , alongside other people , for the recognition of the legal status of ho@@ stages .
I think there is a problem of sem@@ an@@ tics .
We need to qualify ho@@ stage @-@ taking as &quot; political &quot; ho@@ stage @-@ taking - that &apos;s what it is for the most part - and enable the ho@@ stages to have access to justice , to press charges and to bring their kid@@ nap@@ pers before the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is w@@ rapp@@ ed up in compassion , emo@@ tion and is rejo@@ icing that the ho@@ stages are free .
But who is saying that the ho@@ stages may also have access to justice ?
The court in The Hague has been set up for that purpose .
Why should we not say to the ho@@ stage @-@ tak@@ ers : &quot; You have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war and those of all the Geneva Conventions , we &apos;re going to bring you to justice &quot; ?
I think that is justified , legitimate , plain common sense .
People hear the message , but do not listen , and that shocks me .
That &apos;s my main struggle .
Egyptian Islam@@ ists Take to Stre@@ ets to Den@@ ounce Mor@@ si Trial
An@@ ger is bre@@ wing in the ranks of Egypt &apos;s Islam@@ ists .
Two days before the start of the trial of depos@@ ed President Mohamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
There have been demonstrations throughout Egypt to demand the rein@@ statement of the country &apos;s first democrati@@ c@@ ally @-@ elected president .
&quot; It &apos;s not a trial , &quot; says one Muslim Bro@@ therhood acti@@ vist .
&quot; He has still not been able to see a lawyer and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case documents .
It &apos;s not a trial , it &apos;s a far@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; The trial of President Mor@@ si is a f@@ ake trial , &quot; says an an@@ gr@@ y Mor@@ si supporter . &quot; He should be having S@@ isi tried , not the other way round .
Mor@@ si should try S@@ isi for the massacres of Rab@@ aa , the massacres of Nah@@ da and the massacre by the Re@@ public@@ an Guard .
S@@ isi is a li@@ ar and a trait@@ or . &quot;
Con@@ fron@@ tations bro@@ ke out in Alexand@@ ria , where the police used te@@ ar gas and 60 demon@@ strat@@ ors were arrested .
On Monday , 20,000 polic@@ emen were deployed in front of the Police Academy in Cairo , where Mohamed Mor@@ si will be tried .
H@@ ag@@ el Ac@@ cus@@ es 9 US States of Viol@@ ating Hom@@ o@@ sexual Rights
Since the Federal government recognised same @-@ sex marriage , &quot; all spouses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits , &quot; said the Secretary of Defense in New York , in a speech to the Anti @-@ De@@ fam@@ ation League for the fight against anti @-@ Sem@@ iti@@ sm .
&quot; However , some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex spouses in facilities of the National Guard &quot; set up in their region , he critic@@ ised , acc@@ using these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , such individuals cannot take advantage of numerous social or healthcare services in these bases , or access the shops of the latter .
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard , General Frank Gr@@ ass , to ensure that federal law was implemented .
The refusal by the nine states started with Texas , which refused to implement these measures in Tex@@ an National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Tex@@ an law and the federal law on same @-@ sex marriage .
Indi@@ ana , Georgia , Florida , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Carol@@ ina and West Virginia , followed in refusal , according to a senior Defense official .
The Pent@@ agon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same @-@ sex marriage involves about 5,@@ 600 active individuals , or 17@@ ,000 if the National Guard , the reserve and retired people are included .

Toronto Mayor Ch@@ ases Off Journ@@ alists Se@@ e@@ king to Interview H@@ im on Drug Aff@@ air
In Canada , the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs , according to several media sources .
A video sent to the authorities seems to support these suspici@@ ons .
The man concerned , Rob Ford , has always denied having taken cr@@ ack , but has admitted being partial to cannabis .
This Thursday he dro@@ ve a number of journalists off his property when they came to interview him .
We also think that sometimes pictures need no explanation or comment .
Rab@@ ies Det@@ ected in Cat in Val @-@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise
Officials announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rab@@ ies had been detected in a k@@ it@@ ten in Val @-@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise . The k@@ it@@ ten must have come from abroad as France has not had any native cases of the disease since 2001 .
The k@@ it@@ ten was found in Arg@@ ent@@ eu@@ il on 25 October and died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of rab@@ ies was confirmed by the Pas@@ teur Institute .
&quot; An epidemiological inquiry was initiated to identify and treat any individuals who may have come into contact with the k@@ it@@ ten between 08 to 28 October inclusive , &quot; say the Ministries of Health and Agriculture .
&quot; Five people who had been in contact with the k@@ it@@ ten have already been identified , &quot; and have received preventive treatment .
&quot; Pre@@ ventive treatment for human rab@@ ies administered after contact with the carrier animal but before symptoms appear is very effective , &quot; the press release specifies .
The ministries are currently asking anyone who might have been bit@@ ten , cl@@ aw@@ ed , scr@@ atch@@ ed or lic@@ ked on a m@@ uc@@ ous membrane or on damaged skin by the k@@ it@@ ten , or who own an animal that may have been in contact with the k@@ it@@ ten between 08 to 28 October , to contact them on 08 11 00 06 95 between 10@@ am and 6@@ pm from 01 November .
&quot; France has been clear of rab@@ ies since 2001 . This k@@ it@@ ten or the mother were imported from another country where it is still present , &quot; says the press release .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded &apos; native &apos; case of rab@@ ies was in December 1998 in a fox and that &quot; France was officially declared free of this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health ( O@@ IE ) in November 2001 . &quot;
A case of rab@@ ies in a bit@@ ch illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008 .
&quot; Rab@@ ies is a fatal disease if not treated promptly , &quot; the ministries reminded , and it can be transmitted during the for@@ t@@ night or so before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama &apos;s Health Care Wal@@ k Back
A@@ mid a fi@@ rest@@ or@@ m of criticism , President Obama yesterday wal@@ ked back his o@@ ft @-@ repeated , un@@ ambiguous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers , Re@@ public@@ ans have sl@@ am@@ med the president in recent days for misleading the American public .
Y@@ esterday , Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original pledge .
&quot; For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
Addressing what he called the &quot; fl@@ urr@@ y in the news &quot; about the canc@@ ell@@ ations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace .
Most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even che@@ aper than projected .
&quot; You &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act .
&quot; Let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , &quot; Se@@ beli@@ us said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .
Se@@ beli@@ us , who is overseeing implementation of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act , said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot; mis@@ er@@ ably &quot; since October .
&quot; I am as frustr@@ ated and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone , &quot; she said .
I am e@@ ager to earn your confidence back .
An ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated Se@@ beli@@ us ut@@ tered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an aide se@@ ated behind her at yesterday &apos;s House hearing following a contenti@@ ous exchange with Re@@ p. Bil@@ ly Long , R @-@ Mo . , over whether she should be required to enro@@ ll in Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
More than three hours into the hearing , Long repeatedly pressed Se@@ beli@@ us on why the &quot; archit@@ ect &quot; of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Care Act has not voluntarily for@@ gone government @-@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Health@@ Care@@ .@@ gov , which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of Americans .
V@@ et@@ tel Uses New Special Hel@@ met in Abu D@@ hab@@ i
Luc@@ ky winner J@@ ake V@@ ite Pre@@ k@@ op combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag , while integrating the notions of speed and heat on the track .
German driver , Se@@ bas@@ tian V@@ et@@ tel , quad@@ ru@@ ple Formu@@ la 1 World Champ@@ ion , wor@@ e a special new hel@@ met designed by a 21 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican fan during the free practice sessions for the Abu D@@ hab@@ i Grand Prix on Friday .
V@@ et@@ tel chose the winning entry from 1,500 designs sent in from all over the world as part of a competition run by one of the sponsors , a car brand in his stable .
The winner was invited to the Grand Prix in Abu D@@ hab@@ i with a friend and was able to get up close to the German champion , both on the track and in the p@@ its .
V@@ et@@ tel was expected to wear the hel@@ met in the practice sessions on Friday and Saturday .
He will probably have another special hel@@ met for the race on Sunday designed to mark his fourth consecutive world title .
Au@@ ber@@ v@@ illi@@ ers Resident Laun@@ ches &quot; Parti de la Ban@@ li@@ eue &quot;
Make no mistake ,
in the mind of its founder , Ab@@ del @-@ M@@ ali@@ k Dj@@ er@@ mou@@ ne , the &quot; Parti de la Ban@@ li@@ eue &quot; does not only target sub@@ urban residents .
&quot; I chose a map of France as the logo , &quot; he asser@@ ts .
&quot; When I talk about sub@@ urb@@ s , I &apos;m referring to all those who feel excluded from the larger national family . &quot;
Be that as it may , his project , which was presented during a press conference in his home town of Au@@ ber@@ v@@ illi@@ ers on Thursday , was born from a desire to better defend multicultur@@ alism - the great cultural mel@@ ting pot that , above everything else , character@@ ises these districts .
&quot; My primary proposal is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism , &quot; he says .
Ab@@ del @-@ M@@ ali@@ k Dj@@ er@@ mou@@ ne , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old regional attaché , today claims to be &quot; 100 % a@@ political &quot; , although he has not always been neutral .
An acti@@ vist supporter of Jean @-@ Pierre Chev@@ én@@ ement in 2002 , he later supported Dominique de V@@ ille@@ pin in the district from 2010 to 2011 .
&quot; I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my manif@@ es@@ to are associated with the Le@@ ft , but if people on the Right are prepared to support me , I will listen to them too , &quot; he continues .
&quot; It is only extremis@@ t parties that I will not talk to . &quot;
Besides multicultur@@ alism , Ab@@ del @-@ M@@ ali@@ k Dj@@ er@@ mou@@ ne has built his manif@@ es@@ to - which can be read on the Internet - around various subjects intended to appeal to sub@@ urban residents , especially the young : the right to vote for foreigners , the leg@@ alisation of cannabis , lowering the voting age to 16 , restoration of the function of ca@@ ret@@ aker , etc .
He still needs to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas in the political arena . &quot; It is likely that may be done just in time for the 2014 municipal elections , &quot; he acknowledges .
&quot; The problem is time and money .
However , the &apos; Parti de la Ban@@ li@@ eue &apos; should at least be represented in Au@@ ber@@ v@@ illi@@ ers through my candi@@ d@@ acy and in other towns too I hope , &quot; he adds .
Ab@@ del @-@ M@@ ali@@ k Dj@@ er@@ mou@@ ne claims there are already seven names on the candidate list in mainland France and in Martin@@ ique .

John Ker@@ ry says US sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately &quot; in unprecedented admission
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a so@@ f@@ tening of the U.@@ S &apos;s def@@ ensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
The Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;d been guilty , along with Bar@@ ack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incen@@ di@@ ary re@@ vel@@ ations from wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower Edward Snow@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
The le@@ aks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &quot; There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
He then became the first high @-@ ranking member of the U.@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had cross@@ ed the line , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been abused .
He said : &quot; In some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropriately . &quot;
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that no@@ body will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry ins@@ isted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &quot; We &apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to b@@ low themselves up . &quot;
There is radical extremis@@ m in the world that is h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent and determined to try to kill people and b@@ low people up and attack governments .
So what if you were able to inter@@ cept that and stop it before it happens ?
We have actually prevented air@@ planes from going down , buildings from being b@@ low@@ n up , and people from being assass@@ inated because we &apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
Meanwhile , U.S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. sp@@ ying and conv@@ ince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti @-@ terrorism efforts with the U.S. , the chairman of a Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy of Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti @-@ terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; It &apos;s really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti @-@ terrorism endeav@@ ors , &quot; Murphy , a first @-@ term Dem@@ ocr@@ at and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
And I &apos;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combat@@ ting terrorism , notwithstanding their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
News reports that the N@@ SA sw@@ ept up millions of phone records in Europe have fr@@ ayed relations with some U.S. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of metadata that Nat@@ o allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations cited documents le@@ aked by Snow@@ den that the N@@ SA monitored German Chancell@@ or Angela Mer@@ kel &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
The national intelligence director , James Cl@@ app@@ er , def@@ ended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s comm@@ on@@ place on both sides .
A@@ mid the u@@ pro@@ ar , Murphy said his office is arrang@@ ing the cong@@ res@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers .
Names of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
He said the itin@@ er@@ ary is still being worked out .
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tou@@ gh love &quot; will also be dispens@@ ed .
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of es@@ pion@@ age programs they &apos;ve used for years themselves .
&quot; While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; Murphy said .
Meanwhile , Mr Ker@@ ry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address r@@ anc@@ or over U.S. strategies in the Syria , Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities .
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday , with prices brought down by poor results from Shell the day after an announcement by the F@@ ed that it would be maintaining its support for the economy , as planned .
Australian woman appeals Thai j@@ ail time
A 21 @-@ year @-@ old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days j@@ ail in Ph@@ uk@@ et for fal@@ sely claiming she was ass@@ aul@@ ted by a taxi driver is appe@@ aling the ver@@ dict and has been granted bail .
Ste@@ vie Ro@@ ch@@ elle Bam@@ ford was initially found guilty by a Ph@@ uk@@ et provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men res@@ training her , carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
However , CC@@ TV foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boy@@ friend .
Ph@@ uk@@ et police interviewed Bam@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabric@@ ating the story .
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
Bam@@ ford was sentenced to serve the 15 @-@ day prison term at a low security detention centre on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Ph@@ uk@@ et rather than in an adult women &apos;s j@@ ail .
She is the daughter of former Australian le@@ ague player Peter Tun@@ ks , who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Tele@@ graph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; It &apos;s obviously been a wor@@ rying time but we &apos;re hop@@ eful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; Tun@@ ks said .
Bam@@ ford is appe@@ aling the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 b@@ ah@@ t .
Reports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was holi@@ d@@ aying at the resort area of K@@ rab@@ i in Southern Thailand .
Thai @-@ based legal sources said Bam@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in Ph@@ uk@@ et but war@@ ned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .
However , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Ph@@ uk@@ et , Thailand may also be looking to repair its bat@@ tered tourist image , leading to an acquit@@ tal .
French Police to Ar@@ rest Ander@@ l@@ ech@@ t Sup@@ porters Not Trav@@ elling in R@@ SCA B@@ uses
The French police have decided to impose strict rules ahead of the match between Royal S@@ porting Club of Ander@@ l@@ ech@@ t and Paris Saint @-@ Germain , set for Thursday , Marie Ver@@ be@@ ke , spo@@ kes@@ person for the Brussels @-@ South police district , said on Friday .
Belgian supporters of R@@ SCA who want to travel to the Champ@@ ions League match will have to use the transportation system provided by R@@ SCA .
&quot; The convo@@ y of buses will be escor@@ ted by the police from a former frontier post at Re@@ k@@ em to the PS@@ G st@@ adium , &quot; said the spo@@ kes@@ person .
The arrangement will be the same on the way back .
&quot; If other supporters are int@@ ending to travel to Paris by other means , the French Police Department has said that steps have been taken to permit arrests to be made and people to be taken into custody , &quot; Marie Ver@@ be@@ ke also announced .
Living together in French is the challenge facing the Commission S@@ col@@ aire Mar@@ guer@@ ite @-@ Bour@@ ge@@ oy@@ s ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Bour@@ ge@@ oy@@ s School Board ) .
At the Mar@@ guer@@ ite @-@ Bour@@ ge@@ oy@@ s School Board , 62 % of students have a mother tongue other than French .
This is what inspired a consultation exercise between parents , students , teachers and staff of the education department a year ago to reflect on ways to improve the integration of students who have roots in several cultures .
The School Board has just un@@ ve@@ iled its vision of &quot; Living Together in French &quot; .
The organisation , called Vision Di@@ versité , has been visiting schools for the past year to help students of every origin find common reference points that are not limited to the French language .
Dis@@ covering neighbour@@ hoods , our architecture , our environment are reference points ,
as are the names of great writers and artists , whether they are of French origin or come from elsewhere .
Who are our buil@@ ders ?
&quot; Hence , we are developing projects such that they can identify with all of that , &quot; explains the president of Vision Di@@ versité , A@@ ï@@ da Kam@@ ar .
Michel V@@ enne , from the Institut du Nouveau Monde ( New World Institute ) has identified a number of challenges for the School Board .
&quot; Sharing what Quebec culture is , for example , the sense of belonging , support for people going through the changes we are experiencing within the student body , &quot; he lists .
The Mar@@ guer@@ ite @-@ Bour@@ ge@@ oy@@ s School Board has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers , who , themselves , sometimes come from elsewhere .
Rach@@ ida Az@@ dou@@ z from the University of Montreal will be the scientific director .
Preparation to manage a class in a North @-@ American and Quebec context .
&quot; The real need is for different educational strategies , &quot; she sum@@ mar@@ ises .
The research will address inclusion from every angle : linguistic , educational , social and cultural .
