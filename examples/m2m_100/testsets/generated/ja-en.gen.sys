The reason why the stars emit light and heat is because the energy is produced when the hydrogen atom becomes a combination (fusion) and becomes a more heavy element.
Scientists are working on the development of a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, it is very difficult to solve this problem, and it will take many years to get a practical nuclear fusion reactor.
Steel needles and so on the surface of the water are due to surface tension.
Surface tension is the power that is produced by the hydraulic molecules on the surface of the water to bind each other stronger than the air molecules on it.

In order to return to the former energy level, the extra energy obtained from light must be removed.
It is derived from the emission of small particles of light called “photons”.
Scientists call this process "radiation stimulation release", but this is because the atom is stimulated by bright light to release the particles of light, and light is a kind of radiation.
The following picture shows how atoms are releasing photons; of course, they are actually much smaller than the picture.
Photon is a particle even smaller than the matter that forms an atom.

Among the scientists, some believe that Triceratops ate the plant of the soetts, which were many of the authentic in the White Age.
These plants have sharp and sharp crown leaves, with the appearance of a low tree similar to a shell.
Triceratops may have taken the leaves without force before they ate the stone of the tree.
Other scientists argue that because these plants are extremely toxic, although today animals such as namakemon and other (the dinosaur's descendants) eggs can eat poisonous leaves and fruits, any dinosaur is less likely to have eaten them.

The disadvantage of the zoom lens is that the complexity of the focus distance required to meet the range of focus distance and the number of lens molecules is much greater than the focus lens.
As lens manufacturers reach high standards for the lens they produce, this is becoming no problem.
In this way, the zoom lens realized the image quality that is equivalent to the lens of a fixed focus distance.
Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is that many products have a low limitation (speed) of the lens.
Therefore, cheap zoom lens will be more difficult to use in low-light conditions without using flash.

In this study, it was found that the relationship between pain and disorder in patients with back pain involves depression, fear, and breakdown.
Not depression or fear, but only the breakdown effect was the condition for a weekly structured PA session.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support for the negative perception of pain that distinguished between chronic pain and discomfort arising from normal physical exercise.
The vision, i.e. the ability to see, depends on the sensory organ (i.e. the eye) of the visual system.
The structure of the eye varies from very simple to very complex, depending on the requirements of the organism.
If the structure is different, the functions are different, the wavelength that you feel is different, and the degree of vision is different; also, these structures will require different processing and the number of individuals corresponding to the functions to understand the input signal.
A group is a collection of certain species of organisms within a geographical range.
If all individuals within a group are the same in relation to a specific form of expression, they are called unformity.
When an individual appears as a variation of something that has a specific form, they are called multi-types.
The army of the bear flock moves together in a row, and the way of making the Nest is different.
During the hunting stage, the army of the bear moves together in the night, and during the day, the army of the bear moves together.
In the colonies, the cultivation begins when the available food is reduced.In this period, the colony creates a temporary nest and transforms it as daily.
Rebellions and advances in these pastoral stages will last for about 17 days.
The word cell is derived from the Latin word "cell" which means "small room" and is the origin of the word by a microscope engineer who observed the structure of the cork.
Cells are the basic units of the body of all organisms, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In fact, cells are very basic and important for the study of life and are often referred to as “the component of life”.
The nervous system<unk>ins consistency by sending nerve impulses outside the body to maintain blood flow.

Many people dream of a day when humans can travel to another planet and explore another world.When some want to know what is in the universe, some believe that aliens or other living organisms live on another planet.
But even if that happens, it’s probably not going to last a long time: the stars are very spread and the distance between the stars of “neighboring” is several trillion miles.
Per<unk> there will be a day when your grandchildren will descend to a alien planet and remember the ancient ancestors.
The body of the animal is made up of a lot of cells. animals eat food and digest within the body. most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (not all animals have a brain, not all animals have a brain, not all animals have a brain).
Animals live everywhere on Earth: they grave the ground, swim around the sea, or fly around the sky.
Cells are the smallest functional units of the organic structure.
The cell is derived from the “cella” in Latin that means small rooms.
When you look at an organism by a microscope, you will see that it is made up of tiny tissues of circles and quarters.
The British natural philosopher Robert Hock observed the pieces of Cork with a microscope and confirmed that many small rooms can be seen.
He was the first person to observe the dead cells.
Even when a substance moves from one state to another, the elements or compounds do not change.
Nitrogen as a gas has the same nature as liquid nitrogen.The liquid is more densely, but the number of molecules is the same.
Water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atoms.
In any state of gas, liquid, or solid, the molecular structure does not change.
Even if the physical state changes, the chemical state does not change.
Time is a difficult to understand concept, although it is close to us and it affects all of our activities.
For thousands of years, religious scientists, philosophers, and scientists have been researching about time.
We experience time as a series of events from the future to the present to the past.
Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of an event.
By observing the repetition of cyclic events, you can mark the course of time yourself. cyclic events are the events that occur repeatedly and regularly.
Today, computers are used to operate photos and videos.

For a long time from the 19th to the 20th century, the first indigenous inhabitants in New Zealand were believed to be the Maori, who were hunting a huge bird called the Moa.
After that, the theory was established that the Maorians emigrated from Polynesia in a large boat and took New Zealand from the Moriorians to build an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriorians are a local Morians group who have migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and have developed their own peaceful culture.
There are also other tribes on the Chatham Island who have moved from New Zealand, which were the Maori.
They called themselves Morioriori, and there was a small competition several times, but in the end Morioriori was completely destroyed.
Individuals who have been involved for decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, while honestly assessing difficulties and failures.
As I listen to the stories of individuals, families, and organizations, I was able to gain valuable insights about the people who have influenced good and evil on past history and organization culture.
You may not understand culture because you understand your own history, but at least it helps you understand the position you are placed within the history of the organization.
While evaluating success and realizing failure, individuals and participants as a whole will learn more deeply about the organizational values, mission, motivation, and so on.
In this example, remembering the actions of past entrepreneurs and the successes of them as a result, people have begun to accept new changes and new directions in the local church.
Such successful examples create a positive tendency towards change while alleviating the fear of future change.
Conclusion thinking pattern is a problem-solving method that connects different ideas and fields to find solutions.
The focus of this mindset is on speed, logic, accuracy, and it also strengthens the identification of facts, the reapplication of existing techniques, and the collection of information.
The most important element of this thinking is that "there is only one right answer"; you think only of two answers, whether it is right or wrong.
Such ideas are linked to specific scientific or standard procedures.
This kind of person is rich in logical thinking, can remember patterns, solve problems, or work on scientific tests.
In the sense of reading the minds of others, man is the most excellent species.
This means that other people can predict what they recognize, what they think, what they believe, what they know, and what they want.
Even among these abilities, it is very important to understand the intentions of others, which allows you to solve the ambiguity in the physical behavior that may occur.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of a car, you will think they’re trying to steal someone else’s car.
If you’re a person who loses the key to the car and is trying to penetrate your car, you’ll need to make a different judgment.
MRI is a photograph based on a physical phenomenon called NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) which was discovered by Felix Browho (Stamford University) and Edward Percel (Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, the atom emits a small radio wave by the action of the magnetic field and the radio wave.
In 1970, Dr. Raymond Damadian, a doctor in medicine and researcher, discovered the grounds for using magnetic resonance images as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, the world’s first patent in the field of MRI was recognized.
In 1977, Dr. Dammadian completed the world's first "all-body" MRI recording device and named it "unbeatable" according to his spirit facing difficulties.
Non-synchronous communication is what encourages the time of response to the internal department and others.
Students can work at their own pace and control the pace of instructive information.
It is also possible that the flex-time system is also possible, and the time limit is reduced (Bremer, 1998)
With the use of the Internet and the web, students will be able to access information at any time.
Also, students can ask questions to the lecturer at any time and can expect a fairly quick answer, even if they don’t wait until the next interview.
Postmodern learning methods are free from absolute thinking; excellent learning methods are not one.
In fact, it is not one thing to learn; learning is something that occurs as an experience between the learning and the knowledge presented.
The experience we have ever gained from Sunday’s works and information presentations, learning-based television programs and all of our experiences tell this point.
So many of us realize that we are unable to participate or apply our knowledge to the processes and experiences that are broadcast on television programs.
It is never necessary to check your car, to build a fountain in the back yard, to travel to Peru to explore ancient remains, or to renovate your neighbor’s house.

As mentioned above, the word "esquemo" is still accepted in the United States, but it is considered a dishonest language for people in the Arctic (especially Canada) outside the United States.
You may hear the words that indigenous people in Greenland use, but it is better to avoid using foreigners.
Greenland's indigenous people call themselves Inuit in Canada, and Greenland's Greenland's Karaalec (multiform Karaalite).
There is little crime or hatred to foreigners in Greenland; there is not even a “dirty area” in the city.
Cold weather is the only real danger that unprepared people can face.
If you’re visiting Greenland in the cold season, it’s essential to wear warm enough clothes (thinking how cold it’s to the north).
