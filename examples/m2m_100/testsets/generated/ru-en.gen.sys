The stars emit light and heat, as the fusion (or compounds) of the hydrogen atoms and the formation of more heavy elements from them generates energy.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that will be able to produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a serious problem, and it needs to be solved.It will take a lot of time before useful thermo-nuclear reactors will be built.
The steel needle floats over the water due to surface voltage.
Surface voltage occurs because the water molecules on the water surfaces attract each other stronger than the air molecules above them.
The molecules of water form an invisible film on the surface of the water, which allows objects such as the needle to swim on its surface.
The lens of modern ice konks consists of two corners with a curved hole between them.The two corners help to better stick with ice even when inclined.
Since the bottom of the lesbian is slightly exhausted, when the lesbian is inclined to one or another side, the end, interacting with the ice, also exhausts.
If the konks are inclined to the right, the konks turn to the right, and if the konks are inclined to the left, the konks turn to the left.
In order to return to the previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy obtained from the world.
They do this, throwing out a tiny particle of the world, called the photon.
Scientists call this process "induced radiation", because atoms are induced by bright light, causing the emission of photon light, and light is one of the types of radiation.
Finally, in reality, the photons are much smaller than those that are shown on the picture.
Photons are even less than atoms are made up of.
After hundreds of hours of work, the lights in the lamp end up burning over, and the lamp is no longer working.
After that, it is necessary to necessarily replace the lamp, with exceptional caution.
First of all, the switch of the light device must be turned off or the cable must be disconnected.
This happens because the electricity that comes into the patron, where the metallic part of the lamp is located, can lead to a strong strike by the electric current if you touch the internal part of the patron or the metallic foundation of the lamp when it is still partially in the patron.

Some scientists believe that triseratops were questioned by sagovniki — a species of plants that was common in the melo period.
These plants look like a small palm with a crown of sharp shaped leaves.
Triceratops could use their strong keyword to shake the leaves before eating a stone.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that the dinosaur ate them, even despite the fact that today the lenius and other animals, such as the puppy (the dinosaur's descent), can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If I stood on the surface of the Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So that gravity, of course, will draw you weaker.
The Sun has no cortex like the Earth on which you can stand.The entire Sun consists of gas, fire, and plasma.
As it is removed from the Sun's center, the gas becomes more and more cut off.
The external part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "the shar of the world."

Submarines are ships designed to move underwater and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were armed during the First World War, as well as during the Great Patriotic War. At that time they developed very low speeds and could shoot only at a short distance.
At the beginning of the war, they were mainly moving over the sea surface, but when the radars began to improve and become more accurate, the submarines had to go underwater so that they could not be detected.
The German submarines were called the U-Boat.The Germans were very well understood in navigation and management of their submarines.
Due to the successful experience of the application of submarines, after the war the Germans do not trust to have them in large amounts.

To work on interactive design you will need to re-evaluate your ideas about the information industry and learn to think non-standardly.
Interactive design implies that the elements of the project must be connected to each other, but at the same time have meaning separately.
Zoom objectives have the following disadvantage: they require a more complex focus and a greater amount of lenses to get the ability to use the entire range of focus distances compared to fixed objectives.
This becomes an increasingly less serious problem as lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allowed objectives with a variable focal distance to create quality images, comparable to quality, received by objectives with a constant focal distance.
Another disadvantage of zoom objectives is that the maximum value of the diaphragm (light forces) of such an objective, as a rule, is below.
This makes it difficult to use cheap lenses in conditions of poor lighting without explosions.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a film to a DVD format is the outlet displays.
Most TVs are made in such a way as to please the broad audience.

Unlike other primates, hominids do not use their own hands for moving, supporting or jumping with branches to branches.
The hand and leg schimpans are similar in size and length, which explains the use of hands to maintain body weight when moving on four ends.
The human hands are shorter than the legs, and they have more straight falanches.
The excavable bone of the hand age of two to three million years shows this change of hand specialization with movements of the processing of objects.
Some people believe that a fairly frequent experience of numerous conscious, artificially caused dreams can be very annoying.

In the ordinary party they play on eighteen moons: players start with the first moons on the field and end on eighteen.
The winner is the player who will make the smallest number of strikes by the keyboard, i.e. the swing, at the time of the course completion.
This game takes place on the grass, and the grass around the grass is shorter and is called "green".
Per<unk> the most common type of tourism is recreational tourism, which is associated with travel in most people.
This is when people visit a place that is very different from their usual everyday life to relax and have fun.
Recreational tourists most often visit such public places as beaches, theme parks and campings.
If the purpose of a visit to a particular place is to get acquainted with its history and culture, then this kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sights of a country or focus their attention only on one area.
After the events occurred, the colonialists also called for support.
Among the troops serving as a support for advanced positions were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments of a number of 200 people under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Rida (both later became generals).
The people of Stark occupied positions along the hill with the northern end of the colonial positions.
When the flood flooded a brush along the Mystic river along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the curtain with a short stone wall to the northern coastline in a thick water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark set a call at a distance of approximately 100 feet (30 m) from the fence before him and ordered no one to shoot until the soldiers of the regular army pass through it.
The US plan was based on conducting coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadvader will launch a divergent attack on the British garnison in Bordeaux in order to block any support.
General James Ewing (James Ewing) will lead 700 troops on the other shore of the river to Trenton-Ferry, take under his control the bridge through Assun-Pink-Krik and prevent the withdrawal of enemy troops.
The main attack unit of 2,400 people had to move through the river in nine miles north of Trenton, and then divide into two groups: one, under the command of Green, and the other, under the command of Salivana.
If you increase the distance to run by a quarter to a half mile, the speed becomes not so important, while endurance becomes an absolute need.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, capable of running in less than two minutes, must have an outstanding speed, but whatever it becomes, we need to train endurance.
A certain amount of running across the crossed areas in winter, combined with working in the gym for the upper part of the body – is the best preparation for the running season.
Practice of proper nutrition in itself will not lead to the highest results, but it is able to significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, following effective water balance habits and understanding the various aspects of the use of food additives can help athletes improve their performance and increase the enjoyment of sports.
Running on a medium distance is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many mistakes about the small amount of equipment needed to participate.
Goods can be purchased if necessary, but most of them will have a minimal or zero impact on the results.
Athletes may feel like they like that or that product, even if it does not bring any real benefit.
Atoms can be regarded as one of the most important structural units of all substances.
This is a very complex particle, which, according to the simplified Borovsky model, consists of the central core and the electrons rotating throughout its orbits, which partially resembles the planets rotating around the Sun — see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles – neutron and proton.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, while neutron loading has no. In electrons the electrical charge is negative.
Before examining the victim you first need to investigate the place of the accident to make sure it is safe for yourself.
You should pay attention to the victim’s situation when you approach him, and also take into account any alarming moments at the scene of the tragedy.
If you suffer, trying to help, you’re just worsening the situation.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophic mood contributed to the transition from pain to disability in people suffering from pain in the lower back.
Only the effect of catastrophic moods, not depression or fear, were the condition for regular weekly structured sessions of physical activity.
Those who are exercising constantly need more support due to the cause of negative relationship to pain and to distinguish chronic pain from feelings of discomfort after normal physical exercise.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eye.
There are many different structures of the eye, the complexity of which varies depending on the needs of the body.
Different structures provide different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have a different degree of sharpness.In addition, they require different processing to understand input data and different numbers for optimal functioning.
Population is a set of organisms of a specific species within a specific geographical area.
When all representatives of the population have an identical phenotypical sign, they are called monomorphic.
If a person has several variations of a certain sign, they are polymorphic.
Colonies of cowmorms migrate and build nuts in different phases.
During the curvature phase, the myrvels-curvels move at night, and on the day they stop to rest.
The colony begins the cutting phase with a decrease in the amount of available food. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nestes, changing every day.
Each of these battle or trips lasts approximately 17 days.
The word "cell" comes from the Latin cella, which means "a small room".It was first introduced into circulation by a scientist who studied the structure of the spots under a microscope.
Cells are the basic element of all living beings, all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so substantial and important to the study of life that they are actually typically called “building life cells.”
The nervous system supports homeostasis, sending nerve impulses through the whole body to maintain blood flow and not disturb it.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, which helps keep the body safe from potential threats.
Compared to other strong storms, tornadoes hit a small area, but they can destroy everything on their way.
The tornado breaks up with roots of trees, breaks down with buildings and raises cars into the sky.The strongest storms, which account for about 2 percent of all the tornadoes, last more than three hours.
During these monstrous storms winds burst at a speed of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
People share and use lenses to increase for many thousands of years.
However, the first present telescopes were produced in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a two-links system to make distant objects closer and greater.
Desiracy and selfishness will always be our companions, and the nature of cooperation consists in the fact that, when the majority is beneficial, in the short term, it will always be possible to get more if we act only in our own interests.
We hope that most people will realize that in the long run their best option is to work with others.
Many dream of a day when people will be able to travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some ask the question: what is there? Some believe that on other planets there may be alien or other life.
The stars are dispersed so rarely that between the stars- neighbors trillions of miles.
Per<unk> your grandchildren will ever stand on the top of an alien world and think about their ancient ancestors?
Animals consist of a large number of cells.They eat food and digest it inside.The majority of animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals; the medusa, for example, has no brains).
There are animals in all corners of the earth, they fly over the sky, they swim in the ocean, and they rout the earth.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (sensions).
The word "cell" comes from the Latin word cella, which means a small room.
If you look at the living beings under a microscope, you will see that they are made up of square or balls.
Robert Guk, an English biologist, saw small square spots through the microscope.
He was the first to study the dead cells.
Chemical elements and their compounds can pass from one state to another without any changes.
Nitrogen in the form of gas has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. in the liquid phase it is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
The water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atoms.
It has the same molecular structure regardless of whether it is a gas, a liquid or a solid substance.
Her physical state may change, but her chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and affects everything we do, but it is difficult to understand.
Religious, philosophical and scientific researchers have studied time for thousands of years.
Time seems to us a series of events that follow from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (duration) of events.
The cyclical event is an event that is systematically repeated again and again.
Today, computers are used to process photos and video materials.
On a computer you can create complex animations, which are increasingly used on television and in movies.
Music is often recorded using modern computers, processing and mixing sounds.
Thro<unk> the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were representatives of the Maori people who hunted the giant moa birds.
Then the theory approved the idea that the Maori moved from Polynesia to the "Great Fleet" and occupied New Zealand in the Moriori, founding an agricultural society.
However, new data indicate that the Moriorians were a group of continental Morians who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham archipelago, developing their own self-reliant peaceful culture.
On the Chathem archipelago was another tribe – the Maori, who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Morioriors.There was a few clashes, and in the end, the Moriors were stripped with the face of the earth.
People involved for several decades have helped us to evaluate our strengths and aspirations, while honestly evaluating complexities and even failures.
Hearing how people share their personal, family and organizational stories, we got a valuable idea of the past and some personalities that have had a positive and negative impact on the culture of organizations.
Although the understanding of personal history does not mean the understanding of culture, it at least helps people get an idea of their place in the history of organizations.
By evaluating successes and understanding failures, individuals and all participants deeper uncover to themselves values, mission, and the driving forces of the organization.
In this case, reminding the previous examples of entrepreneurial behavior and the achievements achieved as a result of this success helped people become open to new changes and the new direction of the activity of the local church.
Such successful stories reduced fear of change, creating a positive predisposition to change in the future.
Models of convergent thinking are ways to solve problems that combine different ideas or spheres to find their solution.
The center of this image of thought is the speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the reapplication of existing methods and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this image of thinking is that there is only one right answer.You need to think that there are only two options of answer, namely: the right or the wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific theories and standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, can remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
People are far above the other kinds in the ability to read the thoughts of others.
This means that we can successfully predict what other people feel, intend to do, what they believe, what they know or want.
Among these abilities, the key importance is the understanding of the intentions of others.It allows us to resolve possible uncertainty of physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone breaking the window of the car, then you’d probably assume that he’s trying to steal someone’s car.
He should be assessed otherwise if he lost the keys of his machine and the machine he tried to break was his own.
This phenomenon was discovered in the 1930s by scientists Felix Bloch (Felix Bloch) from Stanford University and Edward Purcell (Edward Purcell) from Harvard University.
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves force the atoms to issue the smallest radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a physician and researcher, discovered the foundations for the use of magnetic resonance tomography as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which became the world’s first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadyan completed the creation of the first MRI device to scan the whole body, which he called "Neukromy".
Asynchronous communication gives time for thinking and reacting to others.
This allows students to work in their own rhythm, as well as to control the rhythm of obtaining learning information.
There are also fewer time limits with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Poutine allows students to have access to information at any time.
Students can also ask questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect fast enough answers without waiting for the next personal meeting.
The postmodernist approach to learning offers freedom from absolute, i.e. there is no one ideal way of learning.
In fact, there is no one thing, worthy of study.Learning occurs in the course of interaction between the student and the knowledge provided.
Our current experience of working with television shows of an informational and educational character, as well as the show form "do yourself" clearly illustrates this moment.
Many of us find that they watch a television show that tells us about processes or adventures in which we never take part and do not apply knowledge from there.
We’re never going to repair a car, build a fountain on the back yard, we’re never going to Peru to explore ancient ruins and we’re never going to do repairs in the house of our neighbors.
Thanks to the connections through the underwater optical cable with Europe and the broadband satellite, Greenland has a good connection, with 93% of the population having access to the internet.
In your hotel or in your hosts (if you stayed in a guest or private house), it is most likely that there will be Wi-Fi or a computer with Internet access.
It has already been mentioned that, although the word "eskymos" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada, consider it offensive.
Although this word can be heard from the mouths of the indigenous inhabitants of Greenland, foreigners should refrain from using it.
The indigenous inhabitants of Greenland call themselves inuites in Canada and calaliths (e.g. — Kalaalleq, e.g. — Kalaallit), that is, the own Greens, in Greenland.
Crime and hatred towards foreigners are practically unknown in Greenland. even in cities there are no "dangerous places".
The only real danger that a person can face without preparation is the cold weather.
If you’re visiting Greenland in the cold weather of the year (thinking that the more north you move, the more cold it becomes), you need to take enough warm clothes with you.
Very long summer days can lead to problems with getting enough sleep and related health problems.
During the summer, be careful with the northern mosquitoes as well. although they do not tolerate any diseases, they may be nasual.
Although the San Francisco economy is associated with its status of world-class attractions, it represents a multi-sector structure.
Among the largest sectors of employment — professional services, government agencies, finance, trade and tourism.
Frequent image in musical works, films, literature and popular culture brought the city and its sights worldwide fame.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with a large number of hotels, restaurants and top-class conference centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country, where the cuisine of other Asian countries is presented: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Walt Disney is the main place of pilgrimage for many American families.
"Standard" visit to the park includes landing at the Orlando International Airport, a bus trip to the Disney Hotel, located on the territory, staying there about a week, without leaving the Disney territory, and returning home.
There are countless many possible options, but most people, talking about a visit to Disney World, still mean exactly that.
Many of the tickets that are sold online through such auction sites as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day tickets that allow you to visit several parks in one day.
Although this is a very common type of transaction, it is prohibited by the Disney rules: tickets are not subject to transfer to another person.
Any camping below the end of the Great Canyon requires permits to visit the remote areas of the state.
For the protection of the canyon permissions are limited and become available on the 1st day of the month, for four months before the start of the month.
Thus, permission for visiting remote territories with the starting date on any day of May becomes available on 1 January.
Places in the most popular areas, such as Bright Angtl Campground near Phantom Ranch, are usually filled as a result of requests received on the first day when they are opened for booking.
There is a limited number of permissions granted to visitors without a preliminary record, which are available in a live order.
Visiting South Africa by car is a wonderful way to see all the beauty of this area, as well as to get into angles beyond the traditional tourist routes.
This can be done on a regular car with careful planning, but a full-powered car is strongly recommended, since many places can only be reached by a full-powered car and a high wheel base.
Planning keep in mind that although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are such.
The visa requirements and their cost are different in all countries and depend on your country.
Each country also has special laws that prescribe which items should be in the machine in the event of an emergency.
Victoria-Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe along the border with the Mumbai Livingstone and near the Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfall, which is the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers a lot of opportunities for a long stay for both adventure seekers and viewers.
In the rain season (from November to March) the volume of water will be higher, and the waters will be more effective.
You will uncertainly throw up if you walk through a bridge or a hill, placed around the waterfall.
On the other hand, it is because of such a large volume of water that your view of the waterfall itself will be unclean beyond all this water!
KV62, can be named the most famous of the tombs in the Valley.In 1922, Howard Carter found here a almost untouched royal residence, in which the young king rested.
However, compared to other royal tombs, the Tutanhamon tomb hardly deserves a visit, as it is much smaller and has small ornaments.
Anyone who wishes to see the evidence of the damage to the mummy, caused when trying to pull her out of the grave, will be disappointed, as only her head and shoulders can be seen.
The basic treasures of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
For visitors who don’t have a lot of time, it’s better to spend it somewhere else.
This temple on the top of the hill was built at the end of the 9th century, during the time of king Yashovarmana's rule.
The hill is worth to go away because of the dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonlesap.
The visit to this place can be comfortably combined with a boat walk through the lake.
The entrance to the temple requires a special "Angkor Pass" pass, so when you go to the Lake Tonlesap, don't forget to take your passport with you.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, but most other states and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
An ancient city in the Jewish mountains has a surprising history that covers thousands of years.
This city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Due to the religious importance of the city and, in particular, the numerous sights of the Old Town, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations intended in Israel.
There are many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires that citizens of Cuba before arrival to Ecuador through international airports or border points missing receive an invitation letter.
This letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and comply with certain requirements.
These requirements should ensure a regular migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens, who are the owners of the U.S. Green Card, must visit the Consulate of Ecuador to obtain exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least 6 months after the date of the end of the trip. You need to provide a "there-to-back" ticket or a ticket to travel to the next destination to confirm the duration of your stay.
Excursions for big groups are cheaper, so if you are alone or twice with each other, get to know other people and join a group of four to six people so the price of the ticket per person is less.
However, you may not be very concerned about this, as tourists are often distributed in such a way as to fill the machines.
In fact, it seems rather a way to convince people to pay more.
On the northern border of Machu Picchu, this rough mountain rises, which can often be seen on the background on many photographs of the ruin.
Below it looks a little scary, and it’s a rough and complex rise, but most people in good physical shape take it in 45 minutes.
Most of the road is exposed to stone stairs, and on the harder areas, steel trails serve as supported perils.
This means, wait for you to breathe out and be more careful in harder areas, especially when wet, because it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cave, through which you have to pass. It is very low and quite narrow.
Exploring the sights and the wild nature of the Galapagos Islands is best spent on a boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
There are at least 60 cruises of different sizes – from 8 to 100 passengers – in the Galapagos Islands.
Most people book their seats in advance (as seats on boats are usually occupied in the top of the season).
Make sure that the agent through which you make the order is a specialist in the Galapagos with good knowledge of a variety of ships.
Thus, you will find the most suitable boat under your interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the northern part of Chile was in the dominion of the Inks, while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuché) inhabited the central and southern parts of the country.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent groups of indigenous Americans who were not fully integrated into the Spanish-speaking community until the independence of Chile.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (in the background of the Napoleonic wars, which for several years left Spain without an effective central government), a decisive victory over the Spanish only managed to<unk> in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (in Spanish: Република Доминикана) is a country in the Caribbean, occupying the eastern part of the island of Haiti (formerly Spain), on which is also located the state of Haiti.
In addition to the beaches with white sand and mountainous landscapes, the country is the homeland of the oldest European city in the Americas, now it is part of Santo Domingo.
The Caribbean is a peoples speaking Arabic languages and arising around 10,000 years BC.
The population of Tajnos significantly decreased due to the actions of the Spanish conquerors in a few years after the arrival of researchers from Europe.
According to the work of Bartolomé de las Casas (History of India), the Spanish conquerors destroyed about 100,000 Taino Indians between 1492 and 1498.
This space was created as an atrium for the 17th century monastery, from which the San Diego temple is the only preserved building.
Now it is the central square where constantly, both day and night, something happens.
A few restaurants are located around the garden, and in the morning and evening in the central countryside often give free concerts.
Two balconies, separated only 69 centimeters, are the birthplace of the old legend of love.
For a few coins you will be able to hear the story from the mouths of the children.
Bowen Island – a popular destination for one-day trips or weekend excursions, where you can ride on kayak, walk on excursions, visit shops and restaurants and much more.
This unique community is located in Hu near Vancouver, and it is easy to reach by a pre-ordered water taxi, departing from Grenville Island in the center of Vancouver.
Those who love active leisure must definitely make a walk through the C-to-Sky corridor.
Located a 1.5 hour drive from Vancouver, Whistler is a precious city that has gained its fame thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In the winter, enjoy one of the best ski resorts in North America, and in the summer, try a real mountain bicycle ride.
You must have permission to spend the night in the "Sire".
Sirena is the only facility where, in addition to camping, there is a student-type accommodation and hot food. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food.
Get a pass in the park directly at the Rangers Station in Puerto Chimenes is possible, but there are no credit cards accepted.
The Park Service (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications) does not issue permits for entrance to the park for more than a month before the expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of $30 or $10 for a day break.
Cook Island is an island state, consisting of free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia in the center of the southern Pacific Ocean.
It is a archipelago of 15 islands, which is divided on 2.2 million square kilometers in the ocean.
Since the islands have the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes called "low Hawaii".
Although they are smaller, they remind some elderly guests of Hawaii to obtain the status of state, without all of their huge hotels and other buildings.
There are no cities on the Cook Islands. but this archipelago includes 15 different islands. the main of them are the islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries, the provision of luxury class services within the framework of the "night and breakfast" system has become a kind of art.
As the leaders in their niche, B&B mini-hostels compete mainly on two main parameters: bed and breakfast.
Accordingly, in the most prestigious establishments of this type, you can find the most luxurious bedwear, for example, handmade loose coatings or an ancient bed.
For breakfast, the owner can serve seasonal local delicacies or special dishes.
The background can be a historic old building with an ancient furniture, a beautiful landscape and a swimming pool.
The idea of sitting in your car and going on a long journey is always attractive in its simplicity.
Unlike more large-scale machines, you probably already know how to drive your machine, and what it has limits.
Installing tents on a private territory or even in a small town can easily attract unwanted attention.
In a word, using a personal car is a wonderful way to make trips, which in itself is rarely the cause of nighttime in the open air.
Camping in the machine is possible if you have a large minivan, out-of-road, sedan or universal with scattering seats.
Some hotels have heritage from the time of the golden century of steam railways and ocean railways until World War II in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In these hotels stayed the rich and famous people of those times, and often they had exciting food and nightlife.
An ancient furniture, the lack of modern amenities and a certain elegant cohesion are also their characteristic features.
Despite the fact that they are usually in private property, sometimes the heads of states and other honorary guests are welcomed there.
A traveller with a lot of money can think about worldwide flights with stops in many of these hotels.
The network of exchange of hospitality is an organization that provides travelers with the opportunity to communicate with the local residents of the cities they are going to visit.
To join such a network, it is usually enough to fill out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional verification.
Then a list of available hosts is provided in print and/or electronic form, where sometimes recommendations and reviews from other travellers can be indicated.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004.The reason for its foundation was that programmer Casey Fenton managed to find a cheap flight ticket to Iceland, but he had no place to stop there.
He wrote an e-mail to local university students and received a huge amount of proposals for free residence.
Hostels are designed mainly for young people — the age of typical guests ranges from twenty to thirty years old, but often you can meet there and travelers older.
Families with children here can be seen rarely, but some hostels allow them to settle in separate rooms.
Beijing, the capital of China, will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will be the place of ceremonies of opening and closing, as well as ice events in the premises.
Other ski competitions will be held in the ski area of Taizzichen in Zhangjiakou, approximately 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
In most temples, an annual festival is celebrated, taking place from the end of November to the middle of May. Dates of the event depend on the annual calendar of each temple.
Most temple holidays are celebrated within the framework of the temple anniversary, the birthday of the central goddess or any other significant event related to the temple.
Temple holidays in Kerala are very interesting to observe, they are accompanied by constant processes of decorated elephants, performances of temple orchestras and other celebrations.
The World Exhibition (which is often referred to as “Expo”) is a large international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries represent art and educational exhibitions in national pavilions, showing world issues or their country’s culture and history.
International garden exhibitions are specialized events on which flowering exhibitions, botanical gardens, as well as everything related to plants are exhibited.
Although theoretically they can take place every year (if they take place in different countries), but in reality it is not so.
These events usually last from three to six months and are held in areas of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different formats of film that have been used for many years. standard 35-mm film (negative 36 to 24 mm) — the most common.
It is usually quite easy to fill up if it ends with you, and it also gives a resolution that is approximately comparable to the one-objective digital mirror.
Some medium-shaped film cameras use a 6 to 6 cm format, and more precisely a 56 mm to 56 mm negative.
Thanks to this, the resolution is almost four times greater than in the 35-mm negative (3136 sq.mm vs. 864).
Wildlife is one of the most complex directions for a photographer, because for her capture it requires a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
The art of photography of the wild nature is often perceived as something that understands itself, but, as in the art of photography as a whole, one picture is worth thousands of words.
Photography of wildlife often requires a long teleobjective, although, for example, for a room of bird or some tiny creature other types of objectives are needed.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, as well as in parks sometimes restrictions are imposed on photographing for commercial purposes.
The environment can be cold, hot or, on the contrary, unfavourable.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, and more than twenty of them, which are spoken by 50 and more million people.
Also written is often easier to understand than pronounced loudly.<unk> this applies to addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce so that it is understandable.
The entire population of many countries is absolutely free to speak English, and in even greater amounts you can expect to encounter limited knowledge, especially among younger people.
Imagine people from Manchester, Boston, Sydney and Jamaica sitting at a table, eating at a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories from their native cities, which are told with a strong emphasis on the local jargon.
Buying food in supermarkets, as a rule, is the cheapest way to eat.If there is no possibility to cook food, the choice is limited to the ready to consume food.
More and more, supermarkets expand the range of ready-made food departments. some even provide a microwave oven or other means for heating food.
In some countries or within stores of certain formats there is at least one, often quite simple, restaurant with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and carry them and contact your insurer with yourself.
They must include an e-mail, address and international phone numbers so that consultation, confirmation or claims can be requested.
Take with you another copy in your luggage and online (send it to yourself by email in the form of a deposit or food in the "cloud").
After taking a laptop or tablet on your journey, you must keep a copy either in the internal memory of that device or on an external disk (to which you will be accessed and in the absence of the Internet).
Additionally, provide copies of the insurance certificate/contact to residents or relatives and friends who have stayed at home and can help.
The bad ones are in their nature non-aggressive, but they will defend themselves if they feel a threat.
If people don’t perceive the wool as a potential danger, they can approach too close, putting themselves at risk.
Drink alcohol in moderate amounts. alcohol affects everyone differently, and knowing your limit is very important.
Possible long-term health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption may include liver damage and even blindness and fatal outcome.
Illegal alcoholic beverages may contain a variety of dangerous contaminants, including methyl alcohol, which in small doses can cause blindness or even death.
Glasses can be cheaper in another country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider the possibility to get an eye check at home, especially if the insurance it covers, and take the recipe with you to use it elsewhere.
With high-quality repairs from famous manufacturers in such regions can arise two problems. some of them can be fake, and original and imported repairs can be more expensive than in the country of production.
Coffee is one of the most sold goods in the world, and you’ll probably see a lot of its varieties in your native region.
However, in the world there are a lot of different options of coffee consumption that is worth trying.
Canyoning (or descent per canyon) is a descent to the bottom of the canyon, which can be both dry and full water.
Canyoning combines the elements of swimming, sliding and jumping, and yet for starting classes in this kind of sport a lot of training or serious physical training is relatively unnecessary (e.g., in comparison with scaling, dive or skiing).
Walking tourism is a kind of outdoor activity, consisting of walking walks in the conditions of a natural environment, often on routes for walking tourism.
Daily walks are carried out at a distance of less than a mile, which can be passed by foot per day.
For a daily walk on the light route, no special preparations are required, it is suitable for everyone who wishes with moderate physical training.
